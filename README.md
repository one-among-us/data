## GitHub Repo 结构

* [data](https://github.com/one-among-us/data) - 条目内容存储
* [web](https://github.com/one-among-us/web) - 网页前端源码
* [backend](https://github.com/one-among-us/backend) - 献花和编辑后端源码

## File Structure

* Directory `/people/<userid>/`: Data for a specific person
  * `info.json5`: Profile information
  * `page.md`: Profile page content
  * `photos`: Photo directory
  * `comments`: List of comments made by other users in the format of `yyyy-mm-dd-{name}-{id}.txt`

* Branch `gh-pages`: Data that's automatically generated by Github Actions
  * `people-list.json`: A list of all people currently in the repository
  * Directory `/people/<userid>/`: Built data for a specific person
    * `page.js`: `page.md` built with MDX

## Multilingual

We are trying to rewrite the multilingual architecture of the website to make it more versatile and more concise in an updated way. During this transitional period, please try your best to use Simplified Chinese as the manuscript, and use automatic conversion or manual proofreading to generate the Traditional Chinese manuscript. After the new multilingual architecture is written, we will re-proofread all Traditional Chinese manuscripts.

## 生成/更新繁体文稿

更新简体文稿之后请手动执行一个脚本生成繁体文稿。（因为 Github Actions 奇怪的问题太多了，还好难测试，还是换成本地构建啦）

构建环境需要安装 docker, 然后 `docker-compose up` 就可以更新繁体了!

这个脚本不会覆盖在已有的繁体文件上的更改，更新已经生成过繁体的简体文稿之后会自动合并，不过还是要手动检查一下哦。

## HData

`/data/hdata.json` defined some data which used for entry properties. Here is some description of it:

* `commentOnly`: `string[]`, the entries which include comments only, like `tdor` or `tdov`
* `exclude`: `string[]`, the directories which would not be handled
* `notShowOnHome`: `string[]`, if you don't want a entry show on the home, add it into this item
* `actualHide`: `string[]`, if you don't want a entry show on the home and won't be redirected by random buttons, add it into this item.  
  If you set a entry in this list, you have no need to set it into `notShowOnHome` again.
* `trigger`: `string[]`, if you think this article is likely to irritate readers and should be restricted, please set this option.

### Example

```json
{
    "commentOnly": [
        "tdor"
    ],
    "exclude": [
        "tdov"
    ],
    "notShowOnHome": [
        "Anilovr",
        "noname3031"
    ],
    "actualHide": [
        "ArtsEpiphany"
    ],
    "trigger": [
        "Xu_Yushu"
    ]
}
```

## Banner and other tagged data

Markup data such as banner can be used in documents. The format is as follows:

`[[ {/*JSON*/} ]]`

The internal JSON schema is as follows:

* `type`: The type of tagged data, can be `banner`
* `icon`: The url of the icon. svg cannot be used.
* `title`: Title of item.
* `text`: Text of item.

### Example

```json
[[ {"type":"banner", "icon":"https://one-among.us/favicon-large.png","title":"Some content of this entry doesn’t correspond to fact","text":"You are probably keeping track of an ongoing event, if you feel uncomfortable or stressed, we suggest that you pause browsing the relevant topics."} ]]
```
