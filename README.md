# Our Data 

这里存了 [One Among Us](https://one-among.us/) 的条目，欢迎贡献！

在贡献之前请阅读我们的 [文档和贡献指南](https://oneamongus.ca/zh-Hans/docs/memorial)。

Please read our [How-We-Work](https://oneamongus.ca/docs/memorial) before contributing.

## GitHub Repo 结构

* [data](https://github.com/one-among-us/data) - 条目内容存储
* [web](https://github.com/one-among-us/web) - 网页前端源码
* [backend](https://github.com/one-among-us/backend) - 献花和编辑后端源码

## File Structure

* Directory `/people/<userid>/`: Data for a specific person
  * `info.yml`: Profile information
  * `page.md`: Profile page content
  * `photos`: Photo directory
  * `comments`: List of comments made by other users in the format of `yyyy-mm-dd-{name}-{id}.txt`

* Branch `gh-pages`: Data that's automatically generated by Github Actions
  * `people-list.json`: A list of all people currently in the repository
  * Directory `/people/<userid>/`: Built data for a specific person
    * `page.js`: `page.md` built with MDX

## Multilingual

We are trying to rewrite the multilingual architecture of the website to make it more versatile and more concise in an updated way. During this transitional period, please try your best to use Simplified Chinese as the manuscript, and use automatic conversion or manual proofreading to generate the Traditional Chinese manuscript. After the new multilingual architecture is written, we will re-proofread all Traditional Chinese manuscripts.

## 生成/更新繁体文稿

更新简体文稿之后请手动执行一个脚本生成繁体文稿。（因为 Github Actions 奇怪的问题太多了，还好难测试，还是换成本地构建啦）

构建环境需要安装 docker, 然后 `docker-compose up` 就可以更新繁体了!

这个脚本不会覆盖在已有的繁体文件上的更改，更新已经生成过繁体的简体文稿之后会自动合并，不过还是要手动检查一下哦。

## HData

`/data/hdata.json` defines metadata for controlling entry behavior and display properties. Here is a description of each field:

* `commentOnly`: `string[]`, entries that contain only comments without full profile pages (e.g., `tdor` or `tdov`)
* `exclude`: `string[]`, directories that will be excluded from the build process entirely
* `notShowOnHome`: `string[]`, entries that exist but are hidden from the home page listing
* `actualHide`: `string[]`, entries completely hidden from both home page and random navigation.  
  Note: If an entry is in this list, you don't need to add it to `notShowOnHome` again.
* `trigger`: `string[]`, entries with potentially triggering content that require content warnings and user confirmation before viewing
* `switch`: `[string, string][]`, paired entries for profile switching functionality. Each pair `[A, B]` allows switching from profile A to profile B.
* `skipAges`: `string[]`, entries where age calculation should be skipped
* `probilities`: `object`, probability weights for displaying entries on the home page. Format: `{"entry_id": probability_value}`. Values between 0.0-1.0 control random display chance. Entries not in this object are always shown.

### Example

```json
{
    "commentOnly": [
        "tdor"
    ],
    "exclude": [
        "tdov"
    ],
    "notShowOnHome": [
        "Anilovr",
        "noname3031"
    ],
    "actualHide": [
        "ArtsEpiphany"
    ],
    "trigger": [
        "Xu_Yushu"
    ],
    "switch": [
        ["profile_a", "profile_b"]
    ],
    "skipAges": [
        "example_entry"
    ],
    "probilities": {
        "XingZ60": 1,
        "Huasheng": 0.5
    }
}
```
