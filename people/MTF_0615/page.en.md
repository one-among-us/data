## Introduction

Her name, Jin Yu, sounds unusual to many Chinese ears at first.
Actually, most people know her better as Dong Jin.

Dong Jin was a special trans girl.
We remembered her as kind, with a lovely voice and sharp gaming skills,
yet there was always something about her that made others feel tender towards her,
even a bit heart‑sore.
In many things she showed her own unique way of seeing the world,
and she was truly loved by her online community.
Though she carried many burdens in life, she held on to her dreams—as she once wrote, “It’s a long story…”

## Art

If we turn back time to Dong Jin’s childhood,
we can already see a girl a little different from the rest.
While other kids were watching cartoons,
she was fascinated by documentaries;
while others were drawing children’s pictures,
she was carefully sketching buildings and cars from around the world;
When others were playing puzzles,
she was pestering her family to help her build electronic kits.

She had wide interests.
In piano lessons she discovered her musical talent:
once she heard a tune, she could play it by ear.
Later, she learned to reproduce music from other works using software and even created a version of *Welcome to New York*.
Even her mother couldn’t tell which version was hers.
But Dong Jin, ever precise, pointed out with a little grin:

> “There’s a quarter‑beat missing—why didn’t you tell me?”

In her hands, music was more than an instrument.
Even a string, a comb, even her teeth could “play” a sound.
That must have been the rhythm of her own world.

Her devotion to art bordered on obsession.
One of her dreams was to become a well‑known music producer.
She also hoped that one day her home would include a well‑built home theatre.
She dreamed of seeing the world — the calm of nature and the pulse of cities, the many faces of life itself.

## Society

> “I don’t want to live just for the sake of living.”

Beyond art, Dong Jin cared deeply about social issues.
She hoped schools would truly care about students’ well‑being, not only their grades.
As a trans girl, she yearned for society to show respect and inclusion for all gender identities,
and for understanding to replace discrimination one day.

She often spoke openly about unfairness.
[Once](https://twitter.com/MTF_0615/status/1817450501941735438?s=19),
after hearing of an old man who broke a shared staircase and charged his neighbours a fortune to use it,
she grew angry about the whole “publicly shared spaces” system that allowed such things to happen.
She even thought of handing out leaflets, saying, “Chinese people have grown numb.”

## Caring

She was not only bright but also kind‑hearted.
She made many friends online and always thought of them with warmth and patience.
Even when struggling with depression herself,
she gave everything she could to help others—small things that brought comfort to lonely souls.
In her final days, she even said to her mother:

> “Let’s go visit that friend on the internet. At least we might bring them a bit of warmth.”

Yet beneath her kindness lay fragility.
She had deep insecurities that sometimes caused her to hurt those closest to her.

Still, the small details she left behind gently tell us—she was never a bad person.

Reading her words now, one can’t help but ache for her.

## Departure

According to her friend Ycl,
at the beginning of 2024 she had only one close friend.
The two used to play game *Tom and Jerry* together.
By September,
she had met someone she loved,
but when her partner suddenly passed away,
she fell into despair and confusion.
By then, Ycl and she were rarely in touch,
and Dong Jin felt abandoned by the world.
She sank into a darkness deeper than ever before.

If you have ever read her posts,
you would know how heavy her heart was.
She grew up in a single‑parent family and had never known full love.
Perhaps because of that,
her greatest wish was simply to find a true friend.

She was never content with the way of the world;
life often tormented her.
In those last months,
she was far too hard on herself—hurting herself more than once, even attempting suicide.
Later, the drug she once used to kill her self was thrown away.

But her will to go was already set.
Friends’ kindness could not hold her back.
At some quiet, unknown hour, she left once again—only this time, everyone knew she would not return.

## Afterword

After Dong Jin's departure,
her grandmother once had a dream:
she saw Dong Jin crouched by a candle, lost in thought.
The old woman didn’t quite understand, 
not realising that Dong Jin had always been a child who loved the gentle glow of candles.

It suddenly came to mind that she liked cooking for herself.
Once she made a dish of her own invention, “Fried Pineapple with Cheese”.
It was sprinkled with a few crushed nuts.
The cheese was cooked a bit too long, turning dry, and the dish didn’t look great.

She had poured herself into it,
worked a bit too hard,
and in the long heat,
what should have been smooth became less sweet.
Yet that time she still tasted it carefully,
saying it was rather nice after all,
and that it smelled good.
Life is often like that—sweet and bitter intertwined, never quite apart.  

She once said that if she could go to Venice one day,
she’d love to try a truly authentic pizza.
Perhaps that was the flavour she had always been longing for.

Dong Jin once hoped to have a home of her own and to travel around the world.
To behold the mountains,
to walk through distant cities,
to meet the souls along the way.

May she find peace beyond the sky.
