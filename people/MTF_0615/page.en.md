## Introduction

GeunYook was a lovely girl with grand dreams. She was proficient in music production and enjoyed playing the "Tom and Jerry" mobile game.
She rescued others many times, earning her the reputation of an indisputable community star.

According to her, I was her only friend at the beginning of 2024.
We enjoyed playing the "Tom and Jerry" game together.
In September, she found someone she liked, but her significant otherâ€™s sudden suicide sent her spiraling into collapse and chaos.
By that time, I was no longer in regular contact with her, and, feeling abandoned by the world, she sank into an unprecedented depression.

## Her Departure

Dissatisfied with the state of the world and tormented by its hardships, she suffered unbearably and had attempted suicide multiple times.
She silently left once again unknown to anyone, but this time, everyone knew she would not return.
