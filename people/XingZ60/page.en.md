[!Tip] We wrote this obituary according to Lili's wishes. Given the long time span, the loss of some parts of her suicide note, and the fact that her friends were in deep grief and reacted in various ways after her death, it is difficult to present this article in a way that fully captures the arrangements and ideas she intended prior to her passing.

## Introduction

Lili (in current Chinese trans circles) was originally known as Z60 on the trans forum limelight and Wu Shiya on the Q&A platform ZhiHu.

During her active years on ZhiHu, she was someone who often half-jokingly said she's just a cis man who's a good trans ally and in denial of her transness.
In early 2022, after losing her phone, she joined the forum limelight and continued to be active in Chinese trans circles.

In July 2022, she started transitioning.
In October 2022, she attempted suicide for the first time.
From October 2022 to April 2023, she temporarily stopped being active in Chinese trans circles.
After that, she returned due to her enthusiasm for the rhythmic game “Maimai” and became even more active in Chinese trans circles.

In September 2023, she came out as trans publicly and got a formal diagnosis.

<PhotoScroll photos={[ '${path}/photos/image0.webp', ]} />

> She was intuitively good at rhythmic games, but due to issues with concentration, she did not play any of the purple (most challenging) tracks.

## Commitment to Community Support

In Lili's view, helping others, especially marginalized individuals, to survive, live, and grow has always been important.

In her spare time, she organized and participated in suicide intervention and rescue operations.
For example, she was involved in the rescue of [Shizuha](https://one-among.us/profile/GLaDOSister).

Her actions provided assistance to others, particularly vulnerable populations. Through her efforts, she did everything in her power to prevent self-harm and suicide.

<h3>Preface</h3>
</Hexagon>

<details style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">

<summary>According to XingZ60's will, I am writing this article to commemorate XingZ60. <br/><br/>This article was meant to be finished a long time ago. However, my language skills were limited, making it difficult to express my thoughts adequately, especially given the profound impact that XingZ60 had on me. Additionally, XingZ60's departure left me in shock, causing me to pause writing. Once I regained some mental clarity, I started to explore and understand XingZ60 from various perspectives, which ultimately led to the creation of this article.<br/><br/>Some say that XingZ60 is a bizarre figure, and everyone has their own unique interpretation of them. The XingZ60 portrayed in this article is limited to my personal understanding alone. This is but one perspective—take it with a grain of salt. Consider both sides and you'll see clearly; follow only one view and you'll remain in darkness.</summary>

<DottedNumber n="II"/>

"The dead are the greatest" and "Respect the deceased" seem to be self-evident and self-evident truths in the minds of most of us. However, everyone seems to have a different understanding of what "respecting the deceased" means.

We witnessed with our own eyes how XingZ60's parents styled their child's appearance to conform to traditional masculine gender expression at the funeral, and hung a buzz-cut portrait at the center of the mourning hall; we also watched as they threw the ashes into a car trunk and drove them away. At the time, many were shocked and angered by the parents' behavior. What they saw as respect for the deceased seemed to be overridden by so-called social customs and by the deep-rooted prejudices of the living themselves

Throughout history, people have tended to 'inscribe a few kind words on their tombstones'—dwelling on their accomplishments while scarcely mentioning, if not entirely omitting, their shortcomings. Wu Zetian alone erected a wordless stele at Qianling Mausoleum, leaving her merits and faults to be judged by posterity. In this regard, XingLili resembles the latter. They once said that upon one's death, all rights and wrongs, merits and demerits, become "a final judgment to be rendered"; everyone is free to pass judgment. This sentiment is also reflected in their suicide note—they invited those with differing viewpoints to write the earlier portions of *One Among Us*, and left a message saying, "Anyone may write whatever they wish."

Since XingZ60 had this idea, I'll write some stories freely. Along the way, I want to record some of the thoughts XingZ60 inspired in me, but I'll try to refrain from making value judgments about their actions—letting posterity judge the rights and wrongs, merits and demerits for themselves.

<DottedNumber n="III"/>

XingZ60 appears to have dissociative identity disorder. They have mentioned having at least three personalities—"Nebula," "Illusion," and "Benzene Ring." Among them, one identifies as male, another's gender identity leans toward female, and the gender identity of the third is unknown to me.

I had assumed for a long time that XingZ60 was a transgender woman, but after learning the actual situation, I gave it quite a bit of thought—perhaps this resembles being gender fluid, where it feels that no personal pronoun seems quite right to refer to them.

I'd never met a friend like this before. Later, I noticed some of my other friends wearing a dial-shaped badge. The dial was divided into three sections: sky blue (he), pink (she), and purple (they). By adjusting the pointer to point to any section, you could indicate your preferred pronouns.

Maybe this would be perfect for them.

But looking deeper, the core issue isn't really about pronouns—it's the conflict between XingZ60's different personalities. The pronoun confusion is just how this conflict appears on the surface, specifically at the gender level. But it extends far beyond that. Maybe XingZ60's various personalities differ in temperament, abilities, needs, interests, ideals, and values. So how should we—as friends—treat them? How do we relate to this "composite of multiple personalities"?
And here's a harder question: if XingZ60's will expresses the wishes of only one personality, is it truly valid? By writing this article to honor that will, am I actually respecting the deceased, or am I not?

I hold a legal professional qualification; nevertheless, I lack an answer to this question. My online search yielded only formulaic, mechanical recitations of legal statutes: "Whether an individual with dissociative identity disorder possesses civil capacity is contingent upon their ability to comprehend their own conduct." It appears that such responses fail to substantively resolve the underlying issue.

So someone came up with a workaround and said, "If this is an action taken in a normal mental state, then it is valid; if this is an action taken in an abnormal mental state, then it is invalid." But how do we distinguish between a normal mental state and an abnormal one? Why should an outsider be able to forcibly label "Nebula" as having a 'normal personality' while forcibly labeling "Illusion" as having an "abnormal personality" (or vice versa)?

I don't know the answers to these questions.

<DottedNumber n="IV"/>

XingZ60—or possibly one of their personalities—repeatedly made public jokes about other deceased gender diverse individuals while alive. Consequently, some of XingZ60's friends similarly made jokes about XingZ60 after their passing.
This sparked considerable controversy. Some friends argued that XingZ60's own behavior demonstrated a belief that "it's acceptable to joke about the deceased," and therefore making jokes about XingZ60 was actually a form of respect by honoring their values.
Other friends, however, found this completely unacceptable. The two sides clashed bitterly, and the situation devolved into a complete mess.
Indeed, human sorrows and joys are not shared, and our minds do not operate alike. Yet who is to blame for this? People's minds develop in different ways, and our upbringings and life experiences differ profoundly. Our rational and emotional responses are shaped by the unique neurochemistry within each of us, and the deep reflection and communication required for mutual understanding demand great mental effort.
Thus, human freedom remains constrained by conditions beyond our control—or, as Rousseau observed, man is "everywhere in chains."[^1] It is for this reason that mediation often proves futile; finding resonance between those who see the world differently is a rare gift. Instead, people find themselves at odds, conflicts arise, and wounds are inflicted. And so the world has become, in many ways, a colosseum in disguise.

A certain group is even more of a battleground. Some people ridicule each other in the group and even come to physically assault each other. In the past, trying to 'maintain harmony,' I 'mediated' the conflicts in this group without limit, but it proved ineffective—and sometimes even backfired. Yet XingZ60 said this:

> I can understand both sides, but I can't reconcile them.

What a helpless reality. And the world is full of helplessness. Whether it is between people or between people and things.

Dealing with this dilemma, XingZ60 decided to separate the two groups by making different servers. Since people who earned their success through hard work were going after others who relied on sympathy-baiting for attention, they should just hang out in different spaces. So they started a new group:

> This is a place to lick your wounds, not a place to show off your superiority.

They added many members to the new group who, in their eyes, hadn't made it in the ordinary, worldly sense—some of whom had faced repeated self-harm and drug abuse issues. But XingZ60 opened their heart to all kinds of people with exceptional inclusivity:

> They were all forced.

XingZ60 even publicly said:

> I am no different from you all. Though you see me as a highly educated Beihang graduate, the admission gap that year was simply my good fortune. I was never meant to be set apart—I was meant to be one of you.

Later, I checked the admission score line of Beihang University on the Internet and found that there was no gap in the admission score line that year.

I didn't take it seriously at the time, until I heard about another friend. Raised in a single-parent home with emotional neglect from his guardian, his personality warped under such conditions, leading to drug addiction and being prosecuted by law enforcement.

After hearing this story and reflecting on it, a chilling realization washed over me: had my life also been "derailed" by unfortunate circumstances—had I started in a single-parent family with no emotional support—my fate might not have been much different from this friend's. I could well have been executed for murder and arson years ago.

XingZ60's parents are both teachers. That clicked—her "modesty" about her education finally made sense. I once put her on a pedestal. Then it hit me: no need for that. Same logic—if I had her life, "I could do it too"; if she had mine, "she couldn't do it either."

Thinking of this, I suddenly felt a sense of relief.

<DottedNumber n="V"/>

Yet this world does not turn upon a single factor alone.
And indeed, where one begins in life is but one such factor. It may be an important one, but it is far from the only one.

The world is a vast web, where seven billion people move as one, each contributing in measure great or small to the course it takes.
Each of us is woven into this great web—shaped by its currents, while in turn shaping them.
None can know whom they might encounter in this web, or what experiences await them; still less can they foresee how these encounters will shape the future that lies ahead.

When XingZ60 passed away, some people blamed themselves:

> If only I had checked on her more closely then.
> I should have noticed that her mental state wasn't right.
> There was something off about how she acted at the meal she treated me to the day before yesterday. I was too slow to realize it.
> I was too busy that day, otherwise I would have gone straight to the hospital.

Yet finality descended through a perfect storm of circumstances. All the tragic elements converged simultaneously: XingZ60 was raised in an unfavourable environment, her parents knew everything, no one could spare the time, the hospital found no answers, and every misfortune compounded together inescapably.

So this is the result.

<DottedNumber n="VI"/>

However, XingZ60 continues to wish that I "stand firm in what I uphold"—which presumably refers to "mediating conflicts."

But perhaps I truly can no longer uphold my principles. XingZ60's understanding of these human conflicts appears to have taken root deep within my being. It is as though I inherited a fragment of their spirit and continue living with it—perhaps one day when I pass on, and someone reads what I have written, they too will draw insight from these words and carry those feelings forward.

Later, by chance, I came across a famous saying by a poet: "To die is to fade away, like water vanishing into water.."[^2]

So I opened the window, and the boundless sea revealed itself, vast beneath the warm spring sky with blossoms all around.

<DottedNumber n="VII"/>

However, *Genshin Impact* is a brand-new open-world adventure game independently developed by miHoYo. XingZ60 plays "Genshin"—but this is not that Genshin Impact. For example, maimai DX, which everyone calls the "Arcade Genshin," is also a type of "Genshin."

XingZ60 complained more than once that "Genshin" feels like doing time—like being trapped in a digital prison—and expressed the desire to quit. Every day, she had to face the daily tasks that are nearly identical, repeating themselves day after day. Miss one day's tasks, and you lose out on that day's rewards. Yet whenever the conversation turned to quitting, she would always force herself to stop. Then one day, the following conversation took place between us:

> Hey, have you played the new song updated on the Chinese server? It's called Trans something something light. It's really fun. Other songs are all tap, slide or tap, tap, slide, but this song is tap, tap, tap, slide. It's really fun.

I vaguely remember that their tone was actually full of laughter.

Later, we hugged each other and said goodbye. This was the first time we hugged, and they looked very happy.

> "I will always be with you."

Your brilliance lives on forever. No matter how far, we are together.

<h3>Written at the end</h3>

I've written so much without even realizing it. Perhaps, I think I've captured the experiences I shared with them that matter most to me, and the thoughts and reflections they inspired in me—should all be found here. For considerations of length and other reasons, I think I'll end this piece here. There remain countless stories from life—stories that are somehow the same yet different each day. Some of these I may share through other means, but others I'll simply keep in my memories.

<details style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
<summary>You asked me to compose what you called your "final judgment", and so I wrote it.</summary>

I keep wrestling with this question: of all the people you chose, I must be the one who spent the least time with you and knew you the least. Why did you select me, and what were you hoping I would write? I imagine you understood that in choosing the people to write this section for you, you were also choosing the story that would be told here.
Many things about you—especially those generally seen as negative—I only learned after you were gone. Perhaps if you hadn't brought everything to such an abrupt end, I might have had the chance to hear you tell me these things yourself. But that chance is truly lost to me now.
So I have decided to write only of my experiences with you while you were still alive. Isn't that, after all, what you would have wanted?

There's another dilemma I can't seem to escape: I struggle to capture you as you would have wished to be captured. I find it hard to distill you into crisp, concise words and neatly turned phrases. People's interpretations will always veer away from who you truly were—the biases and imaginings they bring to mere words and sentences would only lead them farther from the truth.
So please allow me here to recount some of our shared memories and offer some rather lengthy, perhaps even vague, impressions. As for who you truly were, I'll leave that for the friends visiting this page to discover for themselves within these words.
Of course, whoever reads this will surely think it would be more at home in the comments section. But please allow me to fulfill your final request in the only way I'm capable of. This, I suppose, is the privilege of the living writing to the dead. If you were still around, none of this would be happening, after all.

The first time I met you—and the only time I ever saw you—was August 12, 2023. That was the moment I had finally emerged from a long period of hesitation, deciding to begin GAHT and connect with the transgender community.
I still remember our meeting vividly. It was midday. I sat by the window in the KFC across from Peking University Third Hospital, eating lunch. When I saw you push open the door and step inside wearing a blue, pink and white mask, I instinctively pulled out a chair to invite you over.
Only later did I realize that I had already been connected to you in the online world for some time. I was a quiet wallflower in the QQ group, rarely speaking, content to simply watch silently. Though you always insisted you were numb to everything—even tragedy—you never failed to offer medication guidance to those who needed it. You were always there to comfort the wounded, and when crisis struck, you made decisive judgments and arranged swift, effective solutions.
In my heart, you have always been a knowledgeable, endearing, and deeply respected helper—and someone so wonderfully approachable. You tried your best to embrace and understand everyone, always giving of yourself, even when it meant giving everything you had.

At that time, as a transgender girl who was just starting out in many things, it was a great fortune for me to meet you. I regard you as a respected senior and a close sister. You would share some unique perspectives with me, give me GAHT advice, and teach me how to fight against the malice from every corner of the world... At that time, when you were in the active group chat, people were always arguing over something. I always feel something similar from your speeches, of course, yours is always much deeper than mine. This made me very interested in your ideas, but I am not good at communicating with people, so we agreed to have a serious chat during the winter vacation. At that time, I didn't know that all this would become impossible in less than a month.

Although I was an eyewitness to the "Werewolf Killing" that took place on December 21, 2023, I still don't know the full story, let alone figure it out. At that time, I was attracted by your profound thoughts and gentle personality, and it was impossible for me to accept that you said such words and did such things. I was instantly disheartened and didn't have any desire to think or ask about it anymore. I chose to stay away from you quietly. But I never thought that just a few days later, I would hear the tragic news of your suicide. I never thought that I could only listen to your situation as told by others. I never thought that the separation on that day might be a real separation. At that time, I found that I was like a stubborn and sulky child. I didn't want to leave you at all, and I didn't want you to leave either.

On December 26, I asked for a dextromethorphan medicine box to make a handmade gift for a friend in another group chat where you were, and you promised to give me one.

On the 27th, you said that you forgot to send the express delivery due to an emergency. I simply thought that you were busy with something and didn't care about you at all.

On the 30th, when I was opening the express package, someone had just told me that you had committed suicide. I hurriedly dug out the express delivery label from the trash can, wanting to keep it as a souvenir, but I didn't expect that I would tear your name neatly in the middle horizontally. All the anxiety, regret and sadness were concentrated in that moment. I was deeply afraid that all this foreshadowed an irreversible tragedy...

I started to have a fever the day after hearing the news, a fever I had never had before. During this period, I could only repeat between pure drowsiness and pure crying with a high fever. Although there seemed to be some not-so-bad news during this period, my memory is really vague, and these not-so-bad news did not turn into not-so-bad facts.

Finally, at 23:56 on January 1, 2024, the nebula, which used to be full of vitality, shining and changing, quietly dissipated in the endless darkness of the universe, became a part of the silence, and merged into the cold darkness.

I read your will with a feeling that I don't know how to describe. There was almost nothing about you in it. It was all about your care, instructions and messages to your friends. When everything for you might be over, you were still caring about the people around you.

I have some selfish desires that I am not ashamed of. If I had not left your personal group on December 21, 2023 because of those things, I would have been able to get your relics as a souvenir, and I would definitely have been able to hear a few of the words you wanted to say to me. In your last words, write what you want to say to your group members at the very beginning. Before reading the will, I didn't know that you cared so much about everyone in that group. My action of leaving the group and distancing myself from you not only caused me endless regret in the future, but also must have hurt you at that time. You didn't say anything to me in your will, but you chose me to be the one to write these things on those autumn leaves. I don't understand why, so just consider it as a punishment for me. However, compared with other people, the interactions between you and me are too few. Maybe you just feel that there is nothing much to say to me. I don’t know, or maybe you have simply forgotten.

I followed my original idea and gave the quicksand mahjong made from the dextromethorphan medicine box you gave me to a friend instead of keeping it for myself as a souvenir. She was also sad that she didn't have the chance to meet you and really get to know you.

It is only in the days when you were gone that I deeply feel your influence on me in every aspect of my daily life. Not only does my GAHT program look almost identical to yours, I have also unconsciously internalized many of your concepts, which factor heavily into my decision-making in life. Although I used to feel that your practice of burning paper, medicine boxes and changing gray portraits to commemorate the deceased was pretentious, I was away from home and could not attend the farewell ceremony to mourn you in person, so I don't know what other reasons drove me to do this for you. In addition to these natural actions, I can't help but think seriously about how I can become a person like you in my eyes. I want to be like you and share the beauty and goodness you bring to me with more people who need them. I hope I can do it.

I am still in my own predicament and see no hope, which makes me miss you even more. I've never told you this, but I guess you won't hate it. Whenever I feel hopeless for various reasons and find it difficult to express or communicate with others, I always wish I could hear what you would say about this situation. Even if I had talked to you more in the past, if I could remember more of your thoughts, I might be able to try to find a way out of them, and my helplessness might be alleviated. I also think that if I could internalize your outlook on life and your view on life, which may seem crazy to others, then I would be able to live freely.

Many things have ended, but many things are still going on. Many people died, but many people still have to continue living.

You often compare the past and future changes in the transgender community to an ongoing war, which I didn’t take seriously in the past. I thought it was a bit naive at the time. But for now, wish me good luck in this war, wish us good luck.
I don't know what kind of feelings I have for you, but I feel that at least I loved you.

### Shinonome

<details style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
<summary>With heavy hearts, we mourn the loss of a brave and resilient soul. Though her life was short, it was filled with unwavering struggle and defiance. She lived much like the words spoken by Big Boss in *Metal Gear Solid 2*: "The loser will be liberated from the battlefield. And the winner... will remain. The survivor will live out every one of the rest of his days as a soldier." She was a warrior on this battlefield, and although she was unable to escape the cruelty of the fight, her spirit and determination will never be forgotten.</summary>

Her passing is not a defeat, but a different kind of liberation—freedom from the oppressive forces of a society that could not understand or accept her. She has been released from the endless battle. Her departure is not surrender, but the conclusion of an unjust fight. She no longer has to endure the pain and pressure that society inflicted on her. In the end, she has earned the freedom of her true self.

However, as the quote reminds us, "The winner will remain." Her departure does not mark the end of her story. Her spirit lives on in each of us. She was a warrior to the very end, holding onto strength and courage. We will continue her mission and fight for those still struggling on this battlefield. Her victory was the hope she brought to every transgender person, and the call for more compassion and acceptance in society.

May her soul find peace in another world, free from the confines of this one. Her legacy will continue to inspire us to carry on her unfinished work and keep fighting for a better future.

I don’t know why Mikä did not appear in XingZ60’s epitaph designation,

so I was thinking that if this was the case, maybe it would be better for me not to comment.

However, there seems to be a saying in it that “anyone who wants to write can write it.”

Oh, and it seems that I shouldn’t mention it.

After all, this part of the so-called suicide note was written by me personally after spending several afternoons looking at Jinji Lake outside the window and listening to XingZ60’s voice.

And maybe because of the above, my departure from XingZ60 happened again. There seems to be a close connection that cannot be ignored.

Maybe it also includes the so-called role-playing game of Fake Haku.

After all, playing with her for so long, it literally means playing to death.

<br/>

I didn't expect that I would lose so completely in this two-sided game.

But I also didn't expect that I lost the two-party game and the other party didn't win.

But who won? Think about it carefully. In fact, I, LingYu, KouHaku, and you both won.

If you explain the reason, the originally short message will be too lengthy.

I must mention it. Even the brain can understand it,

I didn't know her very well, but in my opinion he was a good man who supported some disadvantaged people and did a lot of unnecessary and troublesome things. He once tried to suppress his feminine personality and claimed that he would die if he let it go. I thought hrt would make her a better person and encourage her to be herself, but I didn't expect this result.

Perhaps it would have been better to encourage her to correct his mistakes. In my opinion, he is a rational person, just like Zifeng, but they are both dead, okay. And they are all overdosed. Overdose is harmful!

It has been more than a year since then. I hope he can rest in peace.

<summary>My acquaintance with XingZ60 stems from my exploration of my own gender. We met during the exploration and had a lot in common. Perhaps we are of the same kind or have other similarities. We have become very familiar with each other after knowing each other for seven days. Just 72 days left an indelible mark on your life. </summary>

XingZ60 is a very mature person. When I expressed my anxiety about learning about weight, she not only gave me experience and help, but also said "take it slow".

At school, I often call or chat with her to ease the boredom of studying in the third year of high school, listen to them talk about various interesting things, and listen to their stories. From this we learn that XingZ60 is actually quite indifferent to life and death, which adds fun to the grand funeral. Perhaps it was because of depression that death was not far away from her, and perhaps this day would always come. But I didn't expect it to come so suddenly, after half a year of depression...

When I discussed my own spiritual exploration with her, she commented on my words as "no hope". But in her last words, she told me not to flip over. Maybe she was persuading me based on her own experience, but I still embarked on this difficult road.

From what others said, XingZ60 is more complicated and abstract than I had imagined. What I know is just the tip of the iceberg, either because of Yasasi or because of lack of time. But anyway, the second half of XingZ60 is as interesting as a game. I regret that I will never have the chance to meet you again, but in a corner of my heart there will always be a guy named XingZ60 teasing me.
