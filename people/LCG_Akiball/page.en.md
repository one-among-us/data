## Thoughts of Her

> I loved her deeply, and thus I write these words in remembrance.
> 
> By: ling

How did we first meet? I’ve already forgotten most of it.
The chat history vanished when I changed my phone,
but I vaguely recall that it was around April 2025 when we met.

<details>
<summary>I loved you so much that I have nothing else left — all I have is loyalty.</summary>

I became your first partner after you began HRT, and I was truly happy.
I had given up on myself before, yet because of you,
a faint spark of hope and longing for the future reappeared.

Even the way we once tried to end our lives was exactly the same.
Such a twisted coincidence of fate.
We loved each other deeply:
when I last attempted to end my life,
she wrote a farewell letter to me.
And now, as she is gone, I am writing this in her memory.

She once promised we would meet someday.

She said, *I’ll like you — always, forever.*

She often relapsed;
her mental struggles never truly healed.
DID gave her endless headaches,
and MDD and GAD brought her constant pain.
Every day, she was tormented by unending hallucinations.

She told me she wanted to spend her life with me. I agreed — I really did…

Why… why did it have to be this way?

## Introduction

Akiball was a very gentle and adorable transgender girl.
She came from Tianjin and lived mostly in Melbourne, Australia.
You could find her name *Akiball* on nearly every social platform.
She walked through a short yet fulfilling life,
carrying a warmth and tenderness that softened those around her.

Within her existed several consciousnesses:
Miyuki, Lumi, Qiuqiu (the main self), Mika, and mio.
Each carried its own light and colour.
She turned these into her sources of strength rather than shackles.
She was gentle, self‑loving, and strong.
She enjoyed sharing fragments of her life, loved to cook and savour her own dishes, and found joy in gaming.
Among her favourite games were *CS:GO2* and *maimai*.
She always showed people her bright and positive side.

Before she left, she spent time reflecting on her final moments in life.
She said, *“Hello. Goodbye.”*
In those simple four words lay her tender embrace of life and her quiet farewell.
Perhaps that was the last time she appeared in this world as *Akiball* — gently saying goodbye to all who once offered her love and support.

On 19th June 2025, Akiball departed quietly, leaving behind her warmth.
She had long fought against major depressive disorder (MDD),
generalised anxiety disorder (GAD),
complex trauma dissociative disorder (DID)[^1],
and autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
yet she never gave up.

She not only loved life but also cherished her friends, building genuine bonds with each of them.
She often encouraged others to live bravely, becoming a source of comfort and understanding.
Yet the neglect and misunderstanding of her family left her struggling in the dark.
Before leaving, she put on a dress one last time, asked a friend to take her photo to leave behind her final, lovely appearance.
In the end, she chose to leave this world in the most beautiful way she could, freed from pain.

She left because of long‑term abuse and mental illness.
She was like a fragile yet radiant glass orb — transparent and soft, brightening the world around her, yet unable to bear the crushing weight of reality.

May we carry her tenderness forward into the days to come.
By cooking a warm meal, sending a cheerful greeting to a friend, letting out a playful “awoo,” 
posting a gentle tweet, or calling someone “good sister” with a smile, continuing life after farewell.

> “Hello. Goodbye.”

Farewell, Aki.  
May you find, in your next world, no illness of the mind, loving parents who cherish you, and the happiness you always deserved.

[^1]: As written in the original text. The phrase “complex trauma dissociative disorder” is not a standard diagnostic term. It likely refers to Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD) or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). These two are distinct conditions, though both can involve dissociation and depersonalization. Their boundaries are often difficult to verify and mainly depend on subjective experience.
