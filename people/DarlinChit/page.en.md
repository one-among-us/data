## Description

Sakuya had a passion for programming and the web since her childhood. She loved role-playing and simulation games.
She had an interest in game development.
She helped develop many games, including *Pokémon Go* and *The Headmaster*.
In addition to being a talented programmer proficient in languages like Java, PHP, and C++, Sakuya was also skilled in stock trading and video editing.
She once founded a translation group.

She started her own fashion company, but it went bankrupt due to financial problems, causing her to lose almost all her income sources.
She wasn't able to make a comeback.
Subsequently, she moved to Shanghai for a while.
During her time in Shanghai, although she often worried about financial issues, she managed to spend her days relatively happily, thanks to the company and support of her friends.

In her will, Sakuya wrote:
> My death is unrelated to anyone else; it was purely my personal choice. Please do not hold resentment toward others because of it. Live well for yourselves, with sunshine and happiness."
