## Description

Sakuya had been particularly interested in program and internet since her childhood, and she loved playing role-playing games and simulation games. She was also fond of game develpment. She took part in the development of many games such as *Pokémon Go* and *The Headmaster*. Besides, she was skilled at stock trade and video editing.

She had founded a company by herself, but it closed down due to financial problems. She almost lost her livelihood, and she cannot make a comeback. Then she went to Shanghai and lived for a period. During the time in Shanghai, she always worried about financial problems and so on. But with the help of her friends, she got through a difficult time quite happily.

Sakuya wrote these words in her will:
> "My death is irrelative to everyone, it's only my personal choice. Please don't hate other people for that. Please live well for yourselves, with sunshine and happiness."

Rest well, Sakuya. Hope you be happy all along and have a blissful trip to the heaven.
