## Description

Sakuya had a passion for programming and the internet since her childhood. She loved role-playing and simulation games and was keenly interested in game development. She contributed to developing many games, including "PokÃ©mon Go" and "The Headmaster". Besides being a talented programmer proficient in languages like Java, PHP, and C++, Sakuya was also skilled in stock trading and video editing. She once founded a translation group.

She started her own fashion company, but it closed down due to financial problems, leading her to lose almost all her economic sources. It was challenging for her to make a comeback. Subsequently, she moved to Shanghai for a while. During her time in Shanghai, although she often worried about financial issues, she managed to spend her days in relative happiness, thanks to the company and support of her friends.

In her will, Sakuya wrote:

Rest well, Sakuya. May you find happiness and peace. Wishing you a smooth journey to the stars.
