## Description

Katerina (Natasha) is a trans woman from Heilongjiang province. She had a variety of interests and hobbies, including Russian, composite bow, weightlifting, aerial photography, and motorcycle riding.
She also liked liquor; she hoped to open a bar for trans people.

Born in 2003, she always celebrated her birthday on the 27th day of the first lunisolar month.

Katerina was a national second-level archery athlete and once won a provincial competition.
She had riding experience in many provinces and rode a long distance to visit her partner once.

Her QQ avatar came from the opening song video of *Super Cub*. It was an animation of a girl, Koguma, and her story with her second-hand motorcycle.

Following are some of her photos, including her motorcycle:

Katerina loved many kinds of food, including balsam pear and lemon tea, pizza, jiaozi, and Tiramisu.
It could be said that she loved all the delicious dishes.
She was also skilled at cooking.
While living in Guangdong, she grew fond of white-cut chicken.
The dish then became her specialty.

She suffered from domestic abuse in her childhood.
After her parents’ divorce, she lived with her mother.
But their relationship worsened after she came out to her mother about being trans.

According to her friends, although she was sometimes conceited, she was amiable to her friends.
When she was together with friends, she was thrilled and energetic.
She “adopted” a lovely child as her daughter and cared about her.
In September, she sent a composite bow kit as a present to her partner.

Unfortunately, Katerina was threatened by her family during her visit and eventually chose suicide to escape from the pressure.

Katerina, no matter what you want to eat, we will be together to toast with you.

Спокойной ночи, Катерина.
