## Description

Katerina (Natasha) is a trans woman from Heilongjiang province. She had a variety of interests and hobbies, including Russian, composite bow, weightlifting, aerial photography, and motocycle ride. She also liked liquor, and she hoped to operate a bar for transgenders.

Katerina was a national second-level athlete, and got the winner in a provincial competition. She had riding experience in many provinces, and rode a long distance to visit her partner once.

Her QQ avatar came from the opening song video of *Super Cub*. It was an animation of a girl, Koguma, and her story with her second-hand motorcycle.

Katerina loved many kinds of food, including balsam pear and lemon tea, pizza, jiaozi, and Tiramisu cake. Actually, she loved all delicious dishes. She was also skilled at cooking. During the time in Guangdong, she were fond of the taste of white cut chicken. After that, the dish became her speciality.

She suffered from domestic violence in her childhood. After her parents' divorce, she lived with her mother. But their relationship worsened since she told her about her transgender identity.

According to her friends, although she was sometimes conceited, but she was amiable to her friends. When she was together with friends, she was very happy and energetic. She "adopted" a lovely child as her daughter, and always cared about her life.

Unfortunately, Katerina was threaten by her family during a period at home. Under the huge pressure, she finally let herself loose.

Katerina, no matter what you want to eat, we are together with you, then propose a toast to you.

Спокойной ночи, Катерина.
