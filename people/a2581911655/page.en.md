## The End of Her Journey

At the end of 2023, she planned a 3-month journey.

During the time, she came to Guangdong, and got into [Yantian](https://one-among.us/profile/SS3B_0016/)'s Iveco van. She tweeted:

> “It was comfortable to sit on the front passenger-side seat of Yantian's van~”

After that, she arrived in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Henan, and met with many friends.

On January 18th, 2024, she ended her journey reluctantly and said that she won't able to see everyone again until one and a half year later. 

But she couldn't fulfill her appointment. 
The farewell is a life and death parted. Two days later, she attempted to take her life, and finally left us forever.
