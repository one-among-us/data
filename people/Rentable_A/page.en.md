## Introduction

Rentable, a girl who looked a little mysterious, was from Xinxiang, Henan.  
Despite this, she always seemed lively when she was with her friends.

Sometimes she took many kinds of drugs...  

She had someone she cared about.

> My brain is like a ball of paste wrapped up.
> I can’t even remember what happened more than ten seconds ago.
> That's it...good night.

After [YanTian](https://one-among.us/profile/SS3B_0016) passed away, she tried to leave this world by cutting her wrists.

> That feeling of being stripped away bit by bit.
> Watching myself encounter another self in the hallucination.

## Departure

After [SANYIA](http://www.sanyia.top) [was admitted to the mental health hospital again](https://meow.sanyia.top/index.php/archives/357/), Rentable finally lost her last silver of hope.

> Who is homeless, sitting on the street, and crying at three o'clock?
> Oh, it’s me...

SANYIA once told her that she would be discharged from the hospital in July, and this became the last straw for her.  
She finally chose to leave at the beginning of the rainy season.

Be well in the other world.
