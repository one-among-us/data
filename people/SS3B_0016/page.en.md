## Description

Yantian was our friend, they did suicide intervention and other social work in transgender community and was a great company to many.

Everyone liked them very much, so they got an intimate name “Sister Yantian”.

They were also a [railfan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railfan), and their nickname originated from Shenzhen Metro Line 8 (also known as the Yantian Line).

By coincidence, before they celebrated their 23rd birthday, Line 8 Phase 2 opened on 27 December 2023, which extended the line from Yantian Road to Xiaomeisha.

## Their Departure and Our Memorial

At the end of 2023, Yantian was dealing with some troublesome things in Guangdong.
During this period, they overdrawn their energy, but they still worked tirelessly for everyone.

Owing to the need to maintain better sleep, Yantian had been using sedatives for a long time, and their medication gradually exceeded the safe dose.
Plus, they had overdrawn their energy a lot.
These factors put their physical and mental health in danger.

Yantian unfortunately left us due to cardiac arrest on 12th January 2024.
One Among Us members were extremely shocked and sad, too. 
This is a temporary entry for now. We'll finish this when people recover from sadness.

Based on this, We temporarily set up a small space online for them, to make their memorial warmer in this severe winter.

If you wish, you can share your memory of Yantian by comment.
