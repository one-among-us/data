> Good bye, Greenland-1

## Introduction

Suigetsu was a gentle girl who was active on radio waves.

She sometimes seemed too obsessed with technology. However, that was also one aspect of her cuteness.

## Farewell

> Greenland-1 balloon officially lost contact at 17:52:56 last night
>
> Greenland-1, codenamed SS1TP, was released at 17:43:13 on May 6. It carried an experimental amateur radio payload. However, due to the low antenna, power and flight altitude, the balloon was released at 9 minutes and 43 seconds and lost signal.
