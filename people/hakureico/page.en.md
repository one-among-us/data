## Description

Hanasaka was a trans girl who was lively and lovely.
She studied in the School of Mathematics at Liaoning Normal University.

She was proficient in mathematics and enjoyed learning computer science.

She was also a traffic enthusiast.
She was interested in city buses, rail transit and national railways.
Occasionally, she took flights and looked at the blue sky outside the porthole.
Although these were always solo trips.

She was good at playing rhythm game OSU, and uploaded many videos of her gameplay.
She was still online even when she was in a bad mental condition.

Hanasaka also focused on several kinds of games,
such as *THE iDOLM@STER SHINY COLORS* and *Nekopara*.
Sadly, she gradually lost interest in games due to life pressure,
and she no longer updated her activities in games afterwards.

For some reason, her mental health worsened since March 2018. Luckily, there were still people who cared about her.
In early June 2018, she went to IKEA with an acquaintance, and ate tasty and affordable ice cream cones together.

## Her Departure

As Hanasaka described herself on her Zhihu profile: "Just a Giftia, about to be deactivated".

A Giftia is a type of android with a humanoid body in anime *PLASTIC MEMORIES*.
They have their own personality and emotions.
But they can only "live" for a maximum of 81,920 hours,
after which their programming becomes corrupted due to numerous failed attempts at overwriting old information.
If a Giftia is not retrieved and deactivated before the end of their lifespan, it is very likely that they will become "Wanderers". 

Hanasaka used this metaphor to describe her mental state about to collapse.

In May, she used "Mayday" to convey the signal that she was approaching her limit.
Fortunately, she was out of danger later on.

> // I'm probably a fallen angel.
>
> // My unpredictable mood is just like the weather outside.
>
> // Please rest assured, everyone who forwarded my post. It won't crash!

Although she told everyone to go out and take a look at the scenery to relax,
and she also said, "Please keep alive even if you are desperate. In that case, you can make dreams come true."

But she still chose to leave this world in August.

Before that, she entrusted Mizuki, a railfan in the United States, to announce her death on her account.

Mizuki told us a short story instead of publishing a cold obituary.

> Finally went to hell as a devil.
> 
> updated 18-08-09

The sentence was left by her boyfriend to her.
She was seeking the end of her first love, but she couldn't receive an answer.
even if the answer was "Go f*ck yourself"

Finally, she could only leave such words:

> "May the world treat you well."
> 
> "At least better than me."

In fact, how could she possibly be a devil going to hell?
She was a gentle person with a "helper" personality.
She always thought about others without considering herself.
But perhaps it's also the reason why they parted.

At last, she burned her belongings, and drowned in the river that never stopped flowing.

<!-- 死亡原因可能是坠河，但并不能完全确定，因此使用模糊的处理方法（即也可以从比喻理解）。-->

She had been in a world where no one would hate her, and nothing bad would happen.

## Her Letter

Hanasaka left a letter for her only friend:

<!-- 这段话以下全部，包括结尾的两句祝愿，原文都是英文，中文是反向翻译的，请仅修可能造成误解或明显的非刻意语法错误，不大修-->

Now these accounts are free. May she be free too.

Time to sleep friends, and keep smiling, keep alive.
