## About Seven Bird

She was just like her nickname Seven Bird, flew high, flew to the moon.
She built us *Misaka Network* members the website *Misaka Network*, the place where we shared joy.

She was a lively and optimistic girl.
Always willing to help others, she not only cared about us when we are in need, but she also saved many people from suicide.
But “a doctor cannot help themself”, in the end, she was unable to save herself.

She loved rthyme games.
In her last moments, she played the song *Phigros* for the last time to say goodbye.

This is her last wish:

> “The time will come. All of us will be able to live freely as ourselves in this world.”

Wishing you to be able to live happily as yourself on the other side.
We will look at the bright moon when we long for you.
