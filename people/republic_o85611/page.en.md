> “The girl is quite pretty, but she isn’t all there...”

That’s how she once mocked herself in a post.

Ziyuan was such a gentle, lovely girl, just not a very lucky one.

## Yogurt and Cake

As her profile says,
Ziyuan loved yogurt and small cakes.
Perhaps that was the truest summary of who she was.

Yogurt is soft and mellow;
cake is fragrant and sweet.
Both are things children love,
but they spoil easily and must be kept with care,
or they quickly lose their taste.

So it is with girls like Ziyuan as well.

She grew up in a home that was far from peaceful.
After her parents divorced, the violence only worsened.
She was never really cared for, and never had the simple, happy childhood she should have known.

In middle school, the weight of life became too heavy.
Her mind fell badly ill.
She left school and began releasing her pain in desperate, harmful ways.

When others tried to comfort her, her words left them silent:

> A precious life...does that just mean my parents gave birth to me and never looked after me? 
>  
> Thank you, but I want to leave. Even the pain of dying feels better than living.

All anyone could do was to fall quiet, delete their comments, and leave her be.

Maybe in her broken and distorted world,
yogurt and little cakes were the last trace of happiness she could still hold.

## The Edge

For a long time, Ziyuan’s world was like a single‑player game. No one else around.
Later, thankfully, she met a few people willing to listen.

One friend recalled that when they talked by voice call,
she sounded like a homeless child. Her words were a little odd, yet always gentle.

At times, she was touched by light:

> I once thought of jumping into the river. It was midnight, and I sat on the railing, ready to end it.  
>  
> I thought and thought, for so long, until dawn came.  
>  
> The sky looked so beautiful that morning. It moved me, and I decided to live a little longer.

She captured that sky in a photograph.
We now keep it as her avator in profile,
replacing the plain white icon she once used.

## Submerged

Each time she woke in hospital,
she would find tubes running from her body and machines beeping beside her.
A wave of emptiness always came.

Another failed attempt.

Then one day, she was harassed through private messages on Bilibili.
She fought back with strong words,
but the platform flagged her reply as “vulgar content” and permanently banned her account.

It was her last act of self‑defence,
and it left her in complete silence.
What a pointless and bitter injustice.

Perhaps that wound ended her hope in the world.
Two days later,
she tried again to leave, and this time she never woke.

Lightning split the sky.
Skyscrapers rose for all to see,
while the corners by the walls sank quietly beneath the lake.[^1]
