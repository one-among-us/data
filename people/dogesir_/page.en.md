> “Have you seen *The Train Travelling through the Starry Sky*? I want to get on that train, too.”

## Description

Lan Gou, a girl whose cuteness can be proved just from how she talks.

She was also a girl who can create mesmerizing drawings.
We believe, as long as she wants, she would be able to draw anything well.
Here are some of her drawings before she left:

This is her last self description:

> “I don't think I'm going to change it for several months because I poured lots of effort into it”

Now it's never going to change…

She was also a lover of Minecraft.
She had been updating a Minecraft map for a long time on Bilibili
Here are some photos she took:

It was not her first attempt to get on *the train*.
Before the end, she tried **4** times.

She finally got on *the train* she always wanted to get on.
She was not alone; another girl was together with her on the way.

We wanted to receive another postcard from her.

Wish you not lonely on the train. And remember: Look at the star Betelgeuse one more time.
