## Description

Yingying is a trans woman who had undergone sex reassignment surgery. She was a lively and cheerful girl who was interested in electronics and chemistry. She looks very handsome when she rides a bicycle. She always brought happiness to those around her. She had a toothpaste box with the Intel Logo at home. She said that every time people enter her bathroom, that toothpaste box made them laugh. [^1]

She had published a lot of articles and videos about electronics in both her personal Bilibili account and the Bilibili account “Geek Lab” she created. She had also posted some videos about motorcycle riding. She also opened a store on Taobao where she sold and rented out electronics. She hoped to go to Guangzhou to develop her career.

It's a pity that all this stopped abruptly when she lost her life forever in a car accident.

May she still have the same cheerfulness and passion to do what she wanted to do in her next world! [^1]
