It's a pity that all this stopped abruptly when she lost her life forever in a car accident.

After her death, Han Lianyi reflected on her failure to transfer Yuxue to someone else in time when Han was not capable enough for her case, failing to discover Yuxue's obvious signs of suicide in time, and Han's inadequacy in guiding the rescue of Yuxue at hospital. Han hope that this failure could bring some inspiration for future suicide intervention.

May Yuxue become a beautiful girl in heaven and never be discriminated against.
