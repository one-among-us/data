Akira Complex was a wonderful, beautiful, and caring person.

They pushed through their pain for years, bringing joy to many with their exceptional talent and moving music.

But their pain might have been too heavy...

At last, that soul full of love and warmth left us, like a shooting star.
Bright and fragile,
moving but fleeting...

Akira, We will always remember you and your creations.
