Akira Complex was a wonderful, beautiful, caring person.

They managed to work through their pain for years by bringing joy to many with their exceptional talent and sensational music.

But their pain proved to be too much for them...

That soul full of love and warmth left us at last, like a meteor.
Bright and fragile,
shocking but fleeting...

Akira, We will always remember you and your works.
