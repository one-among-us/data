## Introduction

When we speak of Yiran, there is often a sense of quiet mystery.
Compared with others her age, she rarely appeared on open social media platforms.
Instead, she chose to stay in calmer corners of the internet, such as her public Telegram channel.
Those scattered fragments became the traces of how she existed in this world.

Even beyond the transgender community, it is now uncommon for young people to celebrate birthdays by the lunar calendar.
Yiran was an exception.
Most apps do not recognize lunar birthdays, so she could not receive her “official” birthday wishes at the right time.
Yet because of this, in 2023, during both the second lunar month and the leap second lunar month, she was able to celebrate her birthday twice.

Yiran often wrote small pieces of her thoughts.
She built her own blog and once said that she and blogging shared a bond that was hard to explain.
Even if she did not write often, she felt that in cyberspace, this was a place that truly belonged to her.
Perhaps it was this sense of quiet romance that drew her to it.
A blog did not need to be perfect, it simply needed to exist.

She also tried to earn money by helping others set up modded Nintendo Switch consoles,
and by playing Arcaea on behalf of others for a fee.
These small projects often helped lift her mood, even if only a little.

Like many among us, she was a rhythm game enthusiast.
She was active on NetEase Cloud Music,
following composers from rhythm games such as Camellia, USAO, and Jiang Mi Tiao.

She also had her own way of thinking about music.
Once, she shared a video showing an audio project arranged to spell out “F**K U.”
Visually, it appeared confrontational —
yet the sound it produced was unexpectedly beautiful.
Yiran reflected on it this way:

> If you only look at the image, it feels offensive.
> If you only listen to the music, it feels beautiful.
> When we combine sight and sound, we see the whole picture.
>
> In life, don’t we often judge people we have never met based only on hearsay?
>
> We rush to conclusions based on limited information.
> This society moves too fast — perhaps we should slow down.
>
> We can also learn to be calmer,
> letting small streams flow into the sea.

This world moves too quickly.
If people could slow down, even a little, how much gentler it might be.

Despite the many difficulties she faced, Yiran carried a deep kindness toward the world.
She donated to UNICEF and volunteered with the Be My Eyes app,
offering visual assistance to blind and low-vision users through live video.
During her time there, she once received this message:

> “Yiran, you're in good company.”

It touched her deeply, perhaps that was one of the reasons she continued to love this world.

Love often flows both ways.
As she reached out to the world, others quietly cared for her as well.
Once, she received a large box filled with snacks.
The sender left no further information.

> Is anyone going to claim it so I can properly say thank you?”

## Departure

> Living through 2023
> is my only wish.

> By: Yiran, late 2022

Although Yiran rarely spoke directly about her family,
the words she shared revealed how difficult her situation was at home.

Her mental health struggles were not taken seriously by her family.
Instead, her parents threatened to send her to a so-called “internet addiction correction school”[^1].

> My mom was angry because I couldn’t hear her while wearing headphones.
> She said, “Would it really exhaust you to come call me in my room?”
>
> Now I’m not even allowed to wear headphones at home.
> She threw something at me — scared me, scared the cat away too.
>
> She called me but wouldn’t say why.
> Then said if I keep playing games like this, she’ll send me to Situ[^2].

In June 2023, Yiran learned that her parents had begun planning to send her there.
She made the decision to leave her family.

She was firm — and brave.
After watching the film *Deep Sea*, she once wrote:

> Even if the world is grey right now,
> and may stay grey for a long time,
> light will still fall someday.
> Even a little is worth waiting for.

Yiran did not give up hope.
After leaving home, she found a place to stay,
but still needed money for food.
She began selling access to a VPN subscription she had purchased.

> Thank you all so much!!!
> I’ve gathered enough to cover about half a month of living costs.
>
> I’ll never forget your help.
> I’ll keep sharing my hiding days with you.
> If I can reconcile with my mom, I’ll do my best to give back to everyone who helped me.

> I’m alive. I didn’t die.
> My parents can’t find me here.
> I tried talking today — my mom is easier to talk to.
> My dad is the hard one.
>
> I stopped living on compressed biscuits alone.
> I can now manage balanced meals for about 6 CNY each.
> Thank you for your support.
> Love you all. Good night.

She also tried to earn money by helping others “tinker” with their Switch consoles,
and by playing *Arcaea* on behalf of others for a fee.

But reality is often cruel.
Some struggles may never have been shared publicly.
Some thresholds may have been too hard to cross.

But on the stage, tragedy shows us the destruction of what is valuable in life, while comedy reveals what is worthless.
In mid-June, after brief messages of “in emergency” and “not doing well,” we were parted from her.

## A Meal

Yiran once posted this message in her channel:

> Dinner Time:
> 
> well-done street-stall steak + *xuehualao*[^3]
> 
> 22 CNY — mom treated

To live in this world, one needs more than shelter, they must also eat.

In an age of industrialized food,
a street-stall steak and a simple dessert should not require a child
to describe a meal paid for by a parent as being “treated.”

When we go out to eat together, even to places like Saizeriya, an affordable Italian-style restaurant chain,
what matters is usually what we ate,
what we talked about,
and whether we felt happy.

But Yiran wrote that the steak was something her mother “treated” her to.

Perhaps only those who have lived through such family dynamics
can truly understand the weight of that word.

Dear Yiran, what would you like for dinner tonight?
This time, no one is treating anyone. We simply miss you. And there is still a place for you at the table.

[^2]: Situ: Presumd to be the name of that kind of “school”.

[^3]: A cold dessert in North China, similar to stir-fried ice cream.
