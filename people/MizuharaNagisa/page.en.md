> To every one of my friends

> People who know me well usually call me Shui Senpai or Shui Yuan, but my name is actually 水原なぎさ.
> Not my legal name, of course.
> How do I say this?
> During these past few years I've been tormented by chronic depression and anxiety issues.
> I think they finally overcame me today,
> so I decided to end my life.
> I don't really know what would happen,
> either I'd be dead or I'd be in the ICU, lol.
> Regrettablly, I would be unable to enjoy the 3060 video card I just got.
> And Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5.
>
> Everything goes wrong when my family is involved.
> It's better to hope for a better start in the next life?
> Nope, of course I'm not going to come to this cruel world again;
> the worlds portrayed in animes are much better, not that I think they exist.
>
> (Switching my pen.)
>
> I'm tired of everything.
> I still have games to play:
> What would happen to the girls in Zhen Shou Fu?
> Would that character keep waiting for me?
> I'm sorry, but I cannot keep going anymore.
> I really can't find any energy in myself to keep me going.
> This body is also broken, from head to toe.
> Might as well throw it away, along with these health issues.
> I hope that in the next life,
> I can master drawing;
> I can read more books, number exceeding those I've read in this life;
> Most importantly, being a cute girl.
> (Not that I believe in there being a next life, just a wish.)
>
> I want to thank everyone who have helped me during my short life.
> You helped me many times during various time periods of my life,
> but I really can't thank you individually.
> And, Ying, if there really is a world we go to after death,
> I'll mark the route for you.
> Not really, please live healthily and happily in this life.
> Oh, I forgot.
> I have a Vtuber video to watch, I'm going to watch that now.
> Once again, thank you, every one of my friends.
> Sorry for taking your time.

Wish you to be able to meet the girls in Zhen Shou Fu and live happily in another world,
