She was born on March 4th, 2009, in Jining, Shandong.
She longed to be a girl, to wear beautiful dresses, to have long hair, and to have a gentle voice.

## Her hobbies

She had many hobbies.
She loved rhythm games and played Arcaea.
The last song she played was “False Embellishment”.
She also liked to listen to music, create music, make videos, write code and so on.
Some of her videos were very funny, and her music had tons of personality.
She was a talented and versatile person, always full of curiosity and creativity.

## Her dreams

She had many dreams.
She wanted to become a real girl.
She said she wanted to be a forensic doctor in the future.
She wanted to help those who suffered from depression and anxiety.

> She once said she wanted to meet EnderCat

## Signs of leaving

On May 11th, 2023, MoeCat gave Cencen a hair clip and hoped that Cencen would think of her after she left.

On May 12th, 2023, MoeCat started asking Cencen for blessings and hoped that Cencen would wish her “to be a girl in the next life”.

On May 13th, 2023, Cencen sensed that she might commit suicide the next day and informed EnderCat at 11:45 pm that night.
EnderCat tried to inform her parents but failed.

On May 14th, 2023, EnderCat received a forwarded chat record from “Fixing Broken Hearts” at 1:11 am and tried to contact MoeCat and her parents to confirm her status.
At 1:17 am, MoeCat sent EnderCat an apology message and said, “I’m really happy that I met EnderCat in this life”.

## Her departure

But she did not realize her dreams or meet EnderCat.
On May 13th, 2023, she was really happy, as if she had returned to normal.
In the early morning of the next day, she chose to commit suicide.

That was a decision that was hard to accept and understand.
I know she endured a lot of pain and pressure.
She was forced to stop HRT and was given GnRH analogs.
Her parents did not understand her needs, which made her feel hopeless and helpless.

Plus, she initially had no confidence or sense of worth in herself.
She felt useless and unworthy of being loved.
But these were not true.
We always loved her.

Her friend EnderCat called 120 at 1:23 am.
Her parents also called 120 almost at the same time...
Unfortunately, she lost consciousness at 1:25 am on May 14th, 2023 and was taken to the hospital... I don’t know what happened next, but she eventually did not make it.

> “I could have called 120 ten minutes earlier, but I chose to confirm her status first. I blame myself. I will never forget what she said to me at the end: ‘I’m in so much pain, EnderCat, please help me!’” - EnderCat

EnderCat: MoeCat’s friend and one of the main interveners. According to EnderCat, she was the most capable of saving MoeCat. However, because of an obvious mistake, it led to irreversible consequences.

“Fixing Broken Hearts”: MoeCat’s friend and the one who invited MoeCat to join “a group chat”. Because of her, MoeCat could buy HRT medication and meet everyone. According to her, if she did not pull MoeCat into the circle, MoeCat might not have committed suicide.

Cencen: MoeCat’s boyfriend, the first one to sense that MoeCat would commit suicide. According to him, “We may have indeed prolonged her life. Without us, she might have left in March...”
