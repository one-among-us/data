In the Zhihu questions [How’s meeting Xuewulihuameng in real life?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/269853559) and [What do you think of the death-seeking tendencies of Xuewulihuameng?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/268738337), many of her friends expressed their grief and said that she was really kind.
Just before her departure, she still consoled and encouraged one of her friends.

## Her Departure

Xueli wrote at the beginning, “May kind souls be treated kindly by the world.”

But, Xueli herself was a kind, gentle girl...

From the afternoon to the evening of April 1st, 2018, she was still living happily in this world.

However, that same night, she revealed her gender identity to her parents. Her parents reacted horribly.
Then, after browsing numerous negative messages on the internet,
she started to consider taking her own life.

On that quiet night, without letting anyone know, she went to the Huanghuayuan Jialingjiang Bridge...

Following is the last photo she left behind:

Looking into the distance from the bridge,
the blurred lights seemed to be moistened by tears...

After leaving a scheduled suicide note, Xueli chose to leave this world.
When she was found, she wore a beautiful dress, smiling.

She always treated people around her gently,
but what she’d done was so cruel to herself...according to her friends, she was terrified of pain after all.

## After Her Departure

Xueli’s friend [Futajuhuacha](https://one-among.us/profile/Futajuhuacha) was also a very gentle girl.

After her departure, Huacha deeply missed her and eventually ended her life on the same bridge.

“As if the vernal breeze had come back overnight, Adorning thousands of pear trees with blossoms white.”

We are waiting for the day the gentle breeze comes again,
and pear blossoms come out once more,
also waiting for your return, reunion...
