## Description

Xuewulihuameng is a trans girl who is gentle, lovely, kind-hearted but somewhat solitary.

She was skilled in drawing, and she prepared a painting as a present for her friend.
However, her friend only received the painting after her death.

In the two Zhihu questions of [How about the experience of meeting Xuewulihuameng offline?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/269853559) and [How to appraise the death-seeking behavior of Xuewuloihuameng?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/268738337), many of her friends expressed their grief and said that she was really gentle. Even just before her departure, she still consoled and encouraged one of her friends.

She always treated people around her gently. However, what she'd done is so cruel to herself. In one silent night, she left a scheduled will and departed quietly. She wore a beautiful dress, and there was still a sweet smile on her face when she was found.

May she be treated gently in another world and be a happy girl.
