Xuewulihuameng is a transfemale who is gentle, lovely, kind-hearted but somewhat solitary.

She was skilled in drawing and she prepared a painting to her friend as a present. Although it was after her departure when the painting was sent to her friend because of the barrier between different areas.

In these two Zhihu question of [How about the experience of meeting Xuewulihuameng offline?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/269853559) and [How to appraise the seeking death behavior of Xuewuloihuameng?], many friends of her expressed their rememberance and said that Lihua was quite tender. Even before her departure, she still consoled and encouraged one of her friends.

She always treated people around her tenderly. However, what she'd done is so cruel to herself. In one silent midnight, she left an timing will and departed quietly. She weared a beautiful dress, and there is still a smile on her face when she was found by others.

May she be treated tenderly in another world and be a happy girl.
