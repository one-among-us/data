## Description

As her bio says, Shizuha is “a cute girl researching linguistics”.

Shizuha is talented in linguistics and passionate about it.
She researched many languages, including both languages originating from China and foreign languages.
Her ability to effortlessly switch between languages in online chats always brought a lively, cheerful, and even humorous atmosphere to the group.
Not only was she proficient in communicating with many languages,
but she also was quick to come up with examples of how pronunciation and grammar are used in everyday conversations for those languages.

Shizuha’s work is not limited to linguistics.
She had contributed to the community of the *Half-Life* series.
She designed some “GMod” plugins and maps and directed a fan-made work called Combine Prelude for Half-Life 2.
The most noteworthy fact is that she began conducting research on constructed languages,
constructed [Combinese](https://yuyan.fandom.com/zh/wiki/联合军语), [Yupoian](https://yuyan.fandom.com/zh/wiki/尤波伊语) and [Crigàt](https://yuyan.fandom.com/zh/wiki/克里加语) for the project mentioned above, *Combine Prelude*.
Because of her work on this project, she was famous in both the Half-Life and constructed language communities.

Shizuha’s favourite anime is *YuruYuri*.
She used the main character, Akari Akaza, as her profile photo.

Shizuha is persistent and brave, both for creative work and life, and sometimes even stubborn.
Because of that, she had some verbal conflicts with her friends.
These incidents were, however, resolved quickly because of her friends’ understanding of her character.

Shizuha often sought company from friends in the linguistics community because she didn’t feel safe enough.
Whether online or in real life, she always gave and sought warmth from other trans women and girls.

Since Spring 2019, Shizuha was finally able to pass and live as a woman.
Because of that, she was much more confident and more open to sharing photos on social media to show off her cuteness.
However, her life quality went down as both her financial situation and her depression got worse, and she even went to the edge of suicide sometimes.
Even then, she did not stop her efforts to help other trans people.
In [one of her posts on ZhiHu](https://www.zhihu.com/pin/1091048372731047936), she wrote:

> “Although living is painful for me, and I do not know the meaning behind life, I know that I would never regret helping others.”

Even now, this sentence still gives strength to many suicide prevention social workers.
Unfortunately, Shizuha eventually left us, leaving behind many unfinished works.

After Shizuha’s death, many people in the linguistics community, the constructed language community, and the trans community changed their profile photos to black and white to mourn her.

Under the Zhihu question of [What are your thoughts about Zhihu user @Cang_Shan_Jing_Ye ?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/307482232),
not only were there goodbyes from the friends she made,
but also messages from the linguistics community to achieve more in this field;
and messages from the trans community to encourage each other to keep going.
