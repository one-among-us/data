## Description

As her bio says, Jing Ye is “a cute girl researching lingustics”.

Jing Ye is talented in linguistics and passionate about it.
She researched many languages, including both languages originated from China and foreign languages.
She often switch languages while chatting online, so she always seemed lively, cheerful, and even humorous in group chats.
Not only was she proficient in communicating with many languages,
but she also was quick to come up with examples of how pronounciation and grammar are used in everyday conversations for those languages.

Jing Ye's work is not limited to linguistics.
She had contributed to the community of the *Half-Life* series.
She designed some "GMod" plugins and maps; and she was the director of a fanmade work called *Prequel of the United Army* for *Half-Life 2*.
The fact that worth mentioning the most is, she started doing constructed language research,
constructed [联合军语](https://yuyan.fandom.com/zh/wiki/联合军语), [尤波伊语](https://yuyan.fandom.com/zh/wiki/尤波伊语) and [克里加语](https://yuyan.fandom.com/zh/wiki/克里加语) for the project mentioned above, *Prequel of the United Army*.
Because of her work on this project, she was famous both in the *Half-Life* community and in the contructed language community.

Jing Ye's favorite anime is *YuruYuri*.
She used the main character, Akari Akaza, as her profile photo.

Jing Ye is persistent and brave, both for creative work and for life, sometimes even stubborn.
Because of that, she had some verbal conflicts with her friends.
These incidents were however resolved quickly because of her friends' understanding towards her character.

Jing Ye asked for company very often from friends she found in the linguistics community because she didn't feel safe enough.
Whether online or in real life, she was always gave and seeked warmth from other trans women and girls.

Since Spring 2019, Jing Ye was finally able to pass and live as a woman.
Because of that, she was much more confident and more open to showing her cuteness by sharing photos on social media.
However, her life quality went down as both her financial situation and her depression got worse, even went to the edge of suicide sometimes.
Even then, she did not stop her efforts to help other trans people.
In [one of her posts on ZhiHu](https://www.zhihu.com/pin/1091048372731047936), she wrote:

> “Although living is painful for me and I do not know the meaning behind life, I know that I would never regret helping others.”

Even now, this sentence still give strength to many suicide prevention social workers.
Unfortunately, Jing Ye eventually left us, leaving behind many unfinished works.

After Jing Ye's death, many people in the linguistics community, the constructed language community, and the trans community changed their profile photo to black and white to morun her.

Under the ZhiHu question of [What are your thoughts about ZhiHu user @Cang_Shan_Jing_Ye ?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/307482232),
not only were there goodbyes from the friends she made,
but also messages from the linguistics community, to achieve more in this field;
and messages from the trans community, to encourage each other to keep going.
