## Profile

Ani grew up in a single-parent household.
Her selflessness has touched the lives of many.
But in the end, she, who gave others hope, wasn't able to escape death herself.

On that day, Ani fulfilled her last plan to leave silently.
Yet, her death was sudden and shocking.

Comments from the translator:
I do not believe a reunion after death can count...
Whatever you do, don't place your hope on that.

December 29th, **2022**, Ani was found dead without any sign of life.
Her death was confirmed by [方方](https://twitter.com/fang050722) and [铃木真依](https://twitter.com/MissSuzuki23) on Twitter.

This world does not deserve you.
May the other side treat you well.
May you share the joy with those who travel together with you,
on the train travelling through the starry sky.

Death is not the end.
We will meet under the sky of a more loving world.
I wish you the happiness that you missed.

Ani was outed on October 22nd.
[Elihuso](https://twitter.com/ElihusoQ) sought help for her by explaining her situation online.
However, she rejected every offer of help.

> Not accepting any help is my ideal.
> I already went against it twice.
> Once, twice, there will not be a third.

At night, when we look at Betelgeuse, the brightest star in this starry sky:
You will be waving at us, smiling.
