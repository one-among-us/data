This page is dedicated to the unidentifiable victims who lost their lives due to systemic violence towards trans people.
Sometimes, we cannot even get a confirmation on if these people are trans.

### 2022 March 9th, Wu Han Tianjie - Feminine-presenting person stripped and murdered in bathroom.

At 2022 March 9th 15:45, a feminine-presenting person was stripped and murdered in bathroom.
The assailant and the victim's verbal conflict quickly escalated to physical conflict.
The assailant attacked the victim with a knife, causing the victim to bleed to death.

According to the police report and pictures found online,
the gender marker on the victim's ID is male, but the victim was feminine-presenting at the time of the incident.

People in the trans community followed closely on the development of the incident.
Although there is no concrete evidence on if the victim was trans or was crossdressing,
it is undeniable that the nature of the event is a hate crime against trans women or other gender-diverse people.

After the incident, the police tried to blur the details in the report and downplayed the severity of the event.
Their attitude made us question:
Just because the legal gender and the gender-presentation of the victim was different, a murder case as severe as this would not be taken seriously?
Even the discussions after the event would be censored and stifled, causing there to be so little information available?

Nine days after, on 2022 March 18th, One Among Us's official Twitter tweeted:

> For you who left us in Wu Han, who didn't even had a chance to leave a name:
>
> Nine days passed,
> but you are not forgotten.
> Tens of thousands of us are still mourning you.
> Tens of thousands of "she", "he", "they" of us will work together to ensure a tragedy like this won't happen again.
>
> Rest in peace.
