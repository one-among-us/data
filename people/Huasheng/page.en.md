## In Memory of Miss Huasheng

Huasheng is gone. I’ll never see her again.

Her young life ended on April Fool’s Day—A cruel irony that made me check and recheck the news in disbelief.
But no matter how much I tried to deny it, the truth remains: That single encounter became the only encounter.

Huasheng was a good and gentle person.
I first met her in Amoy (Xiamen) at the end of last November.
The coastal city's warmth flushed her cheeks.
She treated my friend and me to a cozy Japanese restaurant.
I stayed at her place that night.
She laid out a mattress for me, brought over a blanket, and asked if I was cold. 
I’ll never forget Huasheng's gentleness, care, and kindness.

Huasheng was hospitable.
That afternoon, she picked us up from Xiamenbei Railway Station and prepared a single-trip metro ticket for me.
I had an NFC transportation card and didn’t need it, so I kept the ticket as a memento.

In Proust's *In Search of Lost Time*, tasting a madeleine dipped in tea brings the past vividly back to life. In the same way, when I take this metro ticket from my keepsake box, Huasheng feels present again—not just a memory, but a living reality.

The nights stretch long and dark; the rain against the window becomes the tears within my heart—tears that will never cease.

That evening, we walked two kilometres along Boyuan Road to buy cat food at a nearby pet store.
We talked the whole way.
And ever since, my memories of that night have carried me back to who Huasheng was in those moments.

There's something uniquely beautiful about seaside city nights—something my own city lacks.
The grilled eel rice she treated me to that night was amazing.
Huasheng, if there ever comes a day we meet again, let me return the favour.

## The Invisible Murder

On the afternoon of April 1st, 2025, Huasheng passed away.

Most people say she took her own life. But those who know the full story understand:
This wasn’t a choice, but the culmination of relentless psychological violence and death threats that pushed her toward collapse.

<details>
<summary>**Under violence without knives, a young life collapsed.**</summary>

It began when she tried to sever ties with her ex,
N—a person with extreme emotional instability,
who had long abused drugs and frequently descended into rage and delusion.
After she unlinked their social media, N began his campaign of harassment.

He sent her her home address, threatening to fly to her city and burn her house down with gasoline, “sending you and your family to hell together.”
He demanded she reestablish their relationship, claiming it was her "only option."
He wielded death threats against both her and her family.

These weren’t just words.
He knew her address.
He was making travel plans.
Huasheng sought help by telling her friends, “He’s coming. I need to run.”
In her work chat, she said someone was trying to kill her.
During her final hours, she argued with N for two hours before writing, "I can't take it anymore," then fell silent.

</details>

This memorial is not just about remembering Huasheng—it's a societal wake-up call:
This was not an isolated case but a reflection of countless silent sufferings. Day after day of mental control, verbal threats, and emotional manipulation can be as deadly as physical violence. This is not "just an argument" or "emotional instability"—it is invisible murder.

We must recognize:

> Stalking and threats are not "an ex who can't let go"—they are crimes;
>
> Violent language is not "things said in anger"—it is a weapon that kills;
>
> Possessive control is not love—it is emotional blackmail;
>
> Prolonged psychological oppression equals domestic violence.

We hope people take emotional harm seriously.
We hope laws respond faster to invisible violence.
We hope no one else will be left as isolated and helpless as Huasheng.

She was gone, but she wasn’t a weak person.

She was someone surrounded by malice for too long, with no hand reaching out.

She was just someone no one caught in time.

May she rest in peace.
May we build a world where falling through the cracks becomes harder.

The same day she passed, her friend Wangmao drove 1,400 kilometres to Nantong to provide crucial information to police and her family—ensuring her death would not be dismissed as mere suicide.
This was murder.
Words and threats took her young life.

What can I do, now that she's gone?
This is the unbearable lightness of being.

They [human lives] are composed like music.[^1]
Guided by his sense of beauty, an individual transforms a fortuitous occurrence (Beethoven’s music, death under a train) into a motif, which then assumes a permanent place in the composition of the individual’s life. 
Anna could have chosen another way to take her life.
But the motif of death and the railway station, unforgettably bound to the birth of love, enticed her in her hour of despair with its dark beauty. 
Without realizing it, the individual composes his life according to the laws of beauty even in times of greatest distress.[^2]

## To the Eternal Star—A Letter to My Dearest Friend

The spring breeze brushes the branches again, but can no longer softly call your name.

The world continues its noisy existence without you, missing only your unique gentleness.

I remember the light in your eyes when you smiled, like midsummer fireflies;

I remember how you spoke with lips slightly upturned, as if hardship had never touched you;

I remember you always saying, "Tomorrow will be better"—like a flower forever reaching toward the sun.

Now you are the wind among the clouds, the stars in night's canvas,
or perhaps the white butterfly flitting past my window at dawn.

I continue gathering beautiful moments in this world,
watching more sunsets and smelling more blossoms—for you.

If rebirth holds truth, may your next life require less strength;

If heaven exists, may it hold the poetry and moonlight you loved.

This meeting was too brief,
this parting, too enduring.

Wangmao, written in tears, April 2, 2025

Huasheng, you said you liked me.
I don't know if it was just to comfort me, but it made me happy.
I liked you too—I cared for you deeply. You were gentle and kind.
Now there's no chance to see you again or taste your cooking.
The Di San Xian you made that night remains vivid in my memory.
May your next life bring you someone worthy of your love.

Your dear friend, Blue-Haired Slime, April 12, 2025
