## In Memory of Miss Huasheng

Huasheng is gone. I’ll never see her again.

Her young life came to a halt in the early morning of April Fool’s Day.
I kept checking and re-checking, unable to believe it, but no matter how much I tried to deny or soothe myself, nothing could change the fact:
after the last time I heard her voice that morning, I never heard it again.
I never saw her again.
A single encounter — our only one—became forever.

Huasheng was a good person, deeply gentle.
I met her for the first time in Amoy(Xiamen) at the end of last November.
The climate was still warm then, and her face carried that warm seaside blush.
I stayed at her place for the night.
She treated my friend and me to a cozy Japanese restaurant.
That night, she laid out a mattress for me, brought over a blanket, and asked if I was cold. 
I’ll never forget it. I love you, Huasheng — your gentleness, your care, your kindness.

She was so warm and welcoming.
That afternoon she picked us up from Xiamenbei Railway Station and even bought me a single-trip metro ticket.
I had an NFC transportation card and didn’t need it, so I kept the ticket as a memento.

In *In Search of Lost Time*, Marcel Proust describes how a single taste of a madeleine can transcend time and bring the past vividly back to life.
That metro ticket, tucked away in a little box for safekeeping, has done the same. Her memory lives on, intact.

The night was long and dark, the rain on the window like tears that would never end.

That evening, we walked to a nearby pet store to buy canned food for a stray cat—two long kilometers along Boyuan Road.
We talked the whole way.
And ever since then, my memories of Huasheng always take me back to that night.

The city was beautiful at night.
There’s something about seaside cities—their nights feel different from any other place I’ve known.
The grilled eel rice she treated me to that night was amazing.
Huasheng, if there ever comes a day we meet again, let me return the favour.
I wish we had the chance.

## An Invisible Killing

On the afternoon of April 1st, 2025, Huasheng passed away.

Most people say she took her own life. But those who know the full story understand:
this wasn’t a choice—it was the result of long-term emotional violence and threats, pushing her closer and closer to collapse.


<details>
<summary>**Under violence without knives or guns, a young life collapsed.**</summary>

It began when she tried to cut ties with her ex,
N — a person with extreme emotional instability,
who had long abused drugs and frequently spiraled into rage and delusion.
After she unlinked their couple status on social media, he started harassing and threatening her non-stop.

He sent her home address.
He claimed he was flying to her city and would burn her house down with gasoline, "so you and your family can go to hell together."
He demanded she re-link the couple status, saying it was her “only choice.”
He threatened her with death—hers and her family’s.

These weren’t just words.
He knew her address.
He was making travel plans.
Huasheng tried to seek help.
She told friends, “He’s coming. I need to run.”
She told her work group chat someone was trying to kill her.
In the last few hours of her life, she argued with N for two hours.
Her last message was: “I can’t take it anymore.” Then she disappeared.

</details>

This memorial is not just about remembering Huasheng.
It’s also a reminder to society:

This was not an isolated case.
It was a mirror held up to the silent suffering of many others.

Psychological abuse, verbal threats, and coercive control can be just as deadly as physical violence. They are not “just arguments” or “mood swings.” They are invisible murder.

We ask you to remember:

> Stalking and threats from an ex aren’t about “not moving on”—they are real crimes;
>
> Violent language isn’t “just venting”—it’s a weapon that can kill;
>
> Possessive control and manipulative affection aren’t love—they are emotional blackmail;
>
> Prolonged psychological pressure is no less destructive than domestic violence.

We hope people will start to take emotional harm seriously. We hope the law will respond faster to invisible abuse. We hope that no one else will be left as isolated and helpless as Huasheng.

She was gone, but she wasn’t a weak person.

She was just someone who had been surrounded by cruelty for too long, with no one there to pull her out.

She was just someone no one caught in time.

May she rest in peace.
And may this world become one where it’s harder to fall through the cracks.

On the same day she passed, her friend Wangmao traveled 1,400 km to Nantong to give information to the police and her family.
Otherwise, the truth might’ve been buried. Once again: this was a murder. It was violence and threats that took her life.

She is gone. And what can I do, now that her presence has vanished from this world?
The unbearable lightness of being...

They [human lives] are composed like music.[^1]
Guided by his sense of beauty, an individual transforms a fortuitous occurrence (Beethoven’s music, death under a train) into a motif, which then assumes a permanent place in the composition of the individual’s life. 
Anna could have chosen another way to take her life.
But the motif of death and the railway station, unforgettably bound to the birth of love, enticed her in her hour of despair with its dark beauty. 
Without realizing it, the individual composes his life according to the laws of beauty even in times of greatest distress.

## To the Eternal Star

A Letter to My Dearest Friend, Miss Huasheng:

The spring wind brushes past the branches again,
but it can no longer softly call your name.

The world remains noisy after your departure,
only missing the gentle warmth that belonged to you alone.

I remember the light in your eyes when you smiled,
like fireflies on a midsummer’s night.

I remember the slight curve of your lips when you spoke,
as if suffering had never beaten you down.

I remember you always saying,
"Tomorrow will be better,"
like a flower eternally reaching toward the sun.

Now you have become the breeze among the clouds, the stars in the night sky,
or perhaps the white butterfly fluttering past my window at dawn.

I continue to collect all the beautiful moments in this world,
watching more sunsets, breathing in more flowers — for you.

If karma truly governs rebirth,
may you never have to be so strong again.

If heaven truly exists,
may it be filled with the poetry and moonlight you loved.

This meeting was too short;
this parting, too long.

Wangmao, written in tears, April 2, 2025

Huasheng, you once said you liked me a lot. 
I don’t know if it was just to make me smile, but it made me really happy.
I liked you too.
I cared about you.
You were so gentle and kind.
But I’ll never get to see you again, never get to taste your cooking again.
The dish you made that night — Di San Xian — was so good.
I hope next life, you won’t meet someone unworthy of your love. I hope you’ll meet someone who truly deserves you.

Your dear friend, Blue-Haired Slime, April 12, 2025
