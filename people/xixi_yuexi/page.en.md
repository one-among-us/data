## Description

> Random rhythm game player here! ! !

Yuexi was a lively and adorable girl who liked to play games, primarily music games.   
She was in mutual love with someone.

Sometimes, she played maimaiDX for a few turns at the arcade in Xinjiekou[^1].

> I feel great today! ~ 9000 points achieved, 9 SSS+, 3 SSS and some small points, exactly 99 points!

Sometimes, she played Arcaea on her tablet to earn ptt[^2].

<br />

She loved to eat barbecue; sometimes, she'd finish a big plate all by herself. How shortsighted.

Sometimes, she mentally turns into a child.

> I caught a doll today, yay!

Love you.

## Departure

After she took a leave of absence from [Nanjing Agricultural University](https://rle.wiki/campus/NJAU.html) and returned home, her already fragile mental state deteriorated further.

> I can’t muster the energy for the hobbies I once loved. What do I have left? Hmm... I might still have an interest in food and clothing. Maybe, just maybe, I can still save myself (laughs)

In the end, she chose to leave during the supposed joyous summer vacation.

> Farewell, YueXi...
