## Description 

Tian Lulu (meaning sweet deer) was a popular *League of Legends* streamer active on platforms like Bilibili and Huya, with a large number of followers.

In *League of Legends*, she had a special fondness for the character Seraphine, the Starry-Eyed Songstress;
she frequently chose this character as her game avatar.
Luluâ€™s profile picture was Seraphine as well.

As a highly skilled player,
Lulu excelled not only with Seraphine but also demonstrated proficiency with other champions,
offering her unique insights.
She was known for her good personality, like never engaging in personal attacks during matches.

Lulu brought many joyful moments to her audience,
occasionally conducting educational streams.
Many viewers learnt from her and developed skills that suit themselves,
becoming proficient players in their own right.

Despite playfully referring to herself as a "feminine boy",
Lulu struggled with gender dysphoria.
She dreamed of growing her hair long,
dressing up in pretty clothes, 
and living authentically without fear of judgment or discrimination.

However, these internal struggles left her increasingly depressed, insecure, and emotionally sensitive.
She craved love but was also terrified of receiving it.  

In truth, Lulu had contemplated leaving this world for a long time.
Beneath her vibrant public persona lay a deep helplessness and despair.

Ultimately, she found herself falling into an irreversible abyss...

"If I could be a jewel person[^1] in my next life, that would be nice..."
