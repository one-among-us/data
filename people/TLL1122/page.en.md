## Introduction  

Tian Lulu was a popular *League of Legends* streamer active on platforms like Bilibili and Huya, with a large number of followers.

She had a special fondness for the *League of Legends* character Seraphine, the Starry-Eyed Songstress, frequently using her in games.
Luluâ€™s profile picture was Seraphine as well.  

As a highly skilled player,
Lulu exceled not only with Seraphine but also demonstrated proficiency with other champions,offering her unique insights.
She was known for her good personality,
never engaging in personal attacks during matches.  

Lulu had brought many joyful moments to her audience,
occasionally conducting educational streams.
Many viewers had learnt from her and developed their own skills,
becoming proficient players in their own right.  

Despite playfully referring to herself as a "feminine boy",
Lulu struggled with gender dysphoria.
She dreamed of growing her hair long,
wearing beautiful clothes, 
and living authentically without judgment or discrimination.  

However, these internal struggles had left her increasingly depressed, insecure, and emotionally sensitive.
She craved love but was also terrified of receiving it.  

In truth, Lulu had contemplated leaving this world for a long time.
Beneath her vibrant public persona lied a deep sense of helplessness and despair about life.  

Ultimately, she found herself falling into an irreversible abyss at last...  

"If I could be a Jewel in my next life, that would be nice..."
