<!-- ## Our Partner Miyako

If there is one word that fits Miyako Kujo best, it might be *someone who stayed*.

Miyako did not post much on their own.
Their posts were few, and rarely shared.
But they often left replies in other people’s comment sections. As Miyako once wrote:

> Because of censorship in the Chinese internet, a lot of pain has nowhere to go but Twitter/X.
>
> I want to do what some bloggers do—leave warm words for people surrounded by negative feelings.
> If you see this while scrolling, feel free to @ me.

Miyako believed that when lonely people post online, they are not always looking for advice.
Often, they just want to know: “Oh, someone noticed me.”
What mattered was not what was said in reply, but that someone replied at all.

So even when few people actually @’d them, Miyako still went into different comment sections, leaving messages here and there—small replies meant to carry warmth and a sense of being heard to strangers behind the screen.

They gave advice when someone felt stuck.

They said “happy birthday” when someone asked for it.

And when someone wanted to leave this world, Miyako wrote a few lines—simple, careful words—hoping they might be enough to make that person stay.

> I really want to be loved…
>
> “I love you.”
>
> It hurts so much… I’m so lonely… is anyone here…
>
> “I’m here.”

Miyako had a deep sense of empathy.
Faced with countless messages, each carrying a weight far heavier than one person should bear alone, they still chose to respond.
Not just with quick comfort, but by trying—truly—to see things from the other person’s point of view.

Even this kind of limited conversation was, in truth, part of suicide prevention.
And yet, we also know that such efforts do not always work.
One person’s strength has its limits.
This may have been something Miyako thought about often.

In the autumn of 2024, an article by [Han Lianyi](https://twitter.com/HANLIANYI331) discussed how understanding suicide risk is a key part of prevention. Miyako responded in the comments, asking:

> I see many posts on Twitter/X that show suicidal thoughts.
> I want to do something, but all I know comes from their past tweets.
> Even private messages make it hard to really assess the situation. I can only use my own experience and words to help them calm down.
>
> Is there a better way to comfort people in moments like this?
> Are there ways to make these conversations more effective?

“When I feel strong, I want to help those still trapped in the dark,” Miyako once said.
“Because I have been there, I want others to move toward the light.”

Even when others told them, “Don’t keep warming others when you haven’t healed yourself.” Miyako replied:

> “Only when I’m warming others do I truly feel that I’m still alive.”

Offline, Miyako was much the same.
On a high-speed train, they once helped two fellow passengers lift their luggage.
Even small acts of kindness could make them happy for a long time.

## Sun, Moon and Stars

Miyako Kujo loved both classical Chinese poetry and modern verse. In their replies, they often continued famous lines of poetry, matching line to line. At times, they also wrote their own.

One such line was: “Let the autumn wind know my heart.”
Miyako followed it with: “So the dust may clear, and the true self be seen.”

Miyako also wrote modern poems.
Below are two poems they wrote around the images of the sun, the moon, and the stars.

**Poem One:**

> There is only one moon, and only one sun.
>
> I cannot be the moon in someone else’s night,
> 
> nor the sun that lights their whole life.
>
> So let me be a star.
>
> Even if I cannot light their face,
> 
> even if I cannot show them the way,
>
> when they look up,
> 
> I am still one among countless stars.
>
> The joy of that moment,
> 
> a small part of it is mine.
>
> And that is enough.

**Poem Two:**

> I am not the sun or the moon in someone else’s sky.
> 
> I am only a star, too far away.
> 
> My light and warmth cannot reach them.
>
> But I am my own sun.
> 
> When you cross light-years to come to me,
> 
> I will offer you my purest warmth,
> 
> my kindness,
> 
> my truest passion,
> 
> and my blessing.

## Ending

Though Miyako was there for so many others, they may have carried their own struggles in silence.

As early as May 2024, Miyako once asked, in the comment section of someone seeking death, whether information about obtaining medication could be shared.

After that, Miyako rarely spoke about their own life.
Whether they had close friends, what their family life was like, or whether they were dealing with mental illness—none of this was mentioned.
It is possible that all of it was carried alone.

Perhaps this echoes the words spoken earlier: “Don’t keep warming others when you haven’t healed yourself.”
The one who had been soaked by rain, and still tried to hold an umbrella for others, the one who did everything they could to bring light to strangers—has now left us.

Perhaps this was not truly their ending.
In this cycle, they were simply stopped at a certain moment.
We do not have the ability to reload a save and begin again.
All that remains is this outcome before us.

## The Transparent Star

Loneliness is a terminal illness.
When it comes to the ultimate questions, humanity as a whole remains a poor student, standing awkwardly during an impromptu quiz, like a stranded fish opening and closing its mouth, yet unable to offer an answer of equal finality.
And yet, I have seen people who, through their own actions, tried again and again to call back companions standing at the edge of death.
These answers may not be perfect, nor are they free from failure, but they are enough to make even death itself fall silent.

Miyako Kujo was one of them.
As they once said, they were not a full moon, only a scattered star.
In the vast digital world, they left little trace. 
Rarely eye-catching, rarely loud.
And yet we may never know how many people, standing at the cliff edge of their own lives, once caught sight of that faint, flickering star. And among them, how many were given, even just once, the chance to choose life again, because Miyako stayed with them.

As a companion active on international social platforms, Miyako understood their limits well.
They knew that those they could reach were only a small number of people, those who had slipped past the silence imposed on certain topics within the Simplified Chinese internet, and found themselves on platforms like Twitter/X.
Even so, they never stopped extending gentle feelers toward the world.

They once wrote:

> I hope to follow the example of a blogger I admire, to offer a few warm words to anyone surrounded by heavy feelings. If you come across this while scrolling, please @ me.

Perhaps Miyako did not expect replies.
Nor was they seeking interaction.
They was simply lighting up their own faint glow, which was quiet and steady.
They let the world know that they were still here, still staying with us.

They rarely spoke of their own pressures or daily struggles.
Instead, they tried to hold others back from despair, to bless them when they reached for even the smallest hope again and again, wishing only that, in this cold world, they might hear an echo in response.

To someone who wrote, “I really want to be loved…”, they replied, “I love you.”

To the call, “It hurts so much… I’m so lonely… is anyone there?”, they answered, “I’m still here.”

Miyako was deeply empathetic.
No matter how heavy the words carried by others, and no matter how often far beyond what one person could reasonably bear, they still chose to respond.
Not with empty comfort, but by truly placing their self in the other’s position.

In truth, even such limited conversations are already part of suicide intervention.
And yet, we also know that intervention does not always succeed.
After all, individual strength was limited, something Miyako had clearly thought about.

In the autumn of 2024, an article by [Han Lianyi](https://twitter.com/HANLIANYI331) pointed out that the most crucial step in suicide intervention lies in analysing the crisis itself.
In response, Miyako asked:

> I see many expressions of suicidal thoughts on Twitter/X. I want to do something, but all I can access are their past posts.
> Even private messages make deeper assessment difficult.
> I can only rely on my own experience and words to help them calm down.
> 
> Is there a better way to offer comfort or specific ways of speaking that might make intervention more effective?

What few people noticed was that, even as Miyako reached outward with warmth and care, their own situation was far from easy.
Their sorrow over loss came from a place they knew well—a darkness that had once nearly consumed them too.

They once said, “When I feel strong, I want to help those still stuck in the mud. Because I’ve been in the dark myself, I want others to face the light.”
And when others replied, “Stop trying to warm everyone else, you haven’t healed yourself,”
they answered, “It’s only when I’m warming others that I truly feel I’m still alive.”

Even small things, such as helping two fellow passengers lift their luggage on a high-speed train could bring them quiet joy.

## Lengthen night and shorten day

There is a clarity in Miyako’s poetry, a lightness stripped of ornament.
When someone wrote, “May the autumn wind know my heart,” they continued, “so the dust may scatter, and the true self be seen.”

They never avoided acknowledging their own smallness or powerlessness.
Between poetry and daily words, the sun, the moon, and the stars appear again and again, mirroring and contradicting one another.

There is regret at being too small to light the world, and yet comfort in becoming one star among many, bringing even the slightest joy to others.
And when someone truly crossed distance and emptiness to draw near their heart, Miyako never held back warmth or blessing—becoming a sun for them.

But we must remember:
In effect, the brilliant sun they once gazed upon was, only an ordinary star on Orion’s arm.
And what blocks light and warmth has never been anything more than distance and the void itself.

**Poem One:**

> There is only one moon, and only one sun.
>
> I cannot be the moon in someone else’s night,
> 
> nor the sun that lights their whole life.
>
> So let me be a star.
>
> Even if I cannot light their face,
> 
> even if I cannot show them the way,
>
> when they look up,
> 
> I am still one among countless stars.
>
> The joy of that moment,
> 
> a small part of it is mine.
>
> And that is enough.

**Poem Two:**

> I am not the sun or the moon in someone else’s sky.
> 
> I am only a star, too far away.
> 
> My light and warmth cannot reach them.
>
> But I am my own sun.
> 
> When you cross light-years to come to me,
> 
> I will offer you my purest warmth,
> 
> my kindness,
> 
> my truest passion,
> 
> and my blessing.

## Where the World Paused

Companionship is never without cost.
As this long journey of staying with others drew toward its end, in May 2024, Miyako once left a comment beneath another user seeking death and asked whether they could share information about acquiring drug.

After that, they rarely spoke of their own life.
We do not know whether there were friends nearby in those final days, what their family relationships were like, or whether they was struggling with mental illness.
Perhaps time had once wrapped their old wounds gently, but it could not heal those that continued to bleed unseen.

In the end, the words *“you haven’t healed yourself”* became prophecy.
This companion, who had been soaked by the rain and wanted only to hold an umbrella for others, who tried in every way to bring light to those around them—eventually left us.

Perhaps this was not truly their ending.
It is only that, in this particular playthrough, the world stopped them at a single moment in time. We do not have the ability to <ruby>reload a save file<rt>OVERLOAD</rt></ruby> and begin again.
All that remains before us is this outcome.

Rabindranath Tagore, who like Miyako, loved the crescent moon and the star-filled sky once wrote:

> On the seashore of endless worlds, children meet.
> 
> The infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous.
> 
> On the seashore of endless worlds, the children meet with shouts and dances.[^1]
>
> Life is like a major sea through,  we meet with a narrow boat Lane.
> 
> When he died, we join the trip, and it has also learned a different world.[^2]
> 

To this day, we cannot know whether, at the moment Miyako took leave of a world they did not truly love.
Yet still believed there was [“something here still worth loving”](https://x.com/windward0032/status/1838489443411661269), they ever thought of those distant seas, violent or silent, where stars so often go unnoticed.
Stars that once held the hands of countless children, and watched them safely home.
Perhaps the truth was never quite as Miyako once said “I could not even show someone the way.”
For on moonless nights at sea, the stars are the only lighthouse there is.
They may at times have felt far removed from this world, distant and estranged.
But not once did they let their light go out.

Miyako was no longer with us, if someone should ask why the sky seems to be missing something, you might tell them this:
perhaps Miyako was only afraid that, in another world, there are children who are still afraid of the dark, still at risk of losing their way, and they wanted to go and keep watch over another boat.
