## Our Partner Miyako

If there is one word that fits Miyako Kujo best, it might be *someone who stayed*.

Miyako did not post much on their own.
Their posts were few, and rarely shared.
But they often left replies in other people’s comment sections. As Miyako once wrote:

> Because of censorship in the Chinese internet, a lot of pain has nowhere to go but Twitter/X.
>
> I want to do what some bloggers do—leave warm words for people surrounded by negative feelings.
> If you see this while scrolling, feel free to @ me.

Miyako believed that when lonely people post online, they are not always looking for advice.
Often, they just want to know: “Oh, someone noticed me.”
What mattered was not what was said in reply, but that someone replied at all.

So even when few people actually @’d them, Miyako still went into different comment sections, leaving messages here and there—small replies meant to carry warmth and a sense of being heard to strangers behind the screen.

They gave advice when someone felt stuck.

They said “happy birthday” when someone asked for it.

And when someone wanted to leave this world, Miyako wrote a few lines—simple, careful words—hoping they might be enough to make that person stay.

> I really want to be loved…
>
> “I love you.”
>
> It hurts so much… I’m so lonely… is anyone here…
>
> “I’m here.”

Miyako had a deep sense of empathy.
Faced with countless messages, each carrying a weight far heavier than one person should bear alone, they still chose to respond.
Not just with quick comfort, but by trying—truly—to see things from the other person’s point of view.

Even this kind of limited conversation was, in truth, part of suicide prevention.
And yet, we also know that such efforts do not always work.
One person’s strength has its limits.
This may have been something Miyako thought about often.

In the autumn of 2024, an article by [Han Lianyi]((https://twitter.com/HANLIANYI331)) discussed how understanding suicide risk is a key part of prevention. Miyako responded in the comments, asking:

> I see many posts on Twitter/X that show suicidal thoughts.
> I want to do something, but all I know comes from their past tweets.
> Even private messages make it hard to really assess the situation. I can only use my own experience and words to help them calm down.
>
> Is there a better way to comfort people in moments like this?
> Are there ways to make these conversations more effective?

“When I feel strong, I want to help those still trapped in the dark,” Miyako once said.
“Because I have been there, I want others to move toward the light.”

Even when others told them, “Don’t keep warming others when you haven’t healed yourself.” Miyako replied:

> “Only when I’m warming others do I truly feel that I’m still alive.”

Offline, Miyako was much the same.
On a high-speed train, they once helped two fellow passengers lift their luggage.
Even small acts of kindness could make them happy for a long time.

## Sun, Moon and Stars

Miyako Kujo loved both classical Chinese poetry and modern verse. In their replies, they often continued famous lines of poetry, matching line to line. At times, they also wrote their own.

One such line was: “Let the autumn wind know my heart.”
Miyako followed it with: “So the dust may clear, and the true self be seen.”

Miyako also wrote modern poems.
Below are two poems they wrote around the images of the sun, the moon, and the stars.

**Poem One:**

> There is only one moon, and only one sun.
>
> I cannot be the moon in someone else’s night,
> nor the sun that lights their whole life.
>
> So let me be a star.
>
> Even if I cannot light their face,
> even if I cannot show them the way,
>
> when they look up,
> I am still one among countless stars.
>
> The joy of that moment—
> a small part of it is mine.
>
> And that is enough.

**Poem Two:**

> I am not the sun or the moon in someone else’s sky.
> I am only a star, too far away.
> My light and warmth cannot reach them.
>
> But I am my own sun.
> When you cross light-years to come to me,
> I will offer you my purest warmth,
> my kindness,
> my truest passion,
> and my blessing.

## Ending

Though Miyako was there for so many others, they may have carried their own struggles in silence.

As early as May 2024, Miyako once asked, in the comment section of someone seeking death, whether information about obtaining medication could be shared.

After that, Miyako rarely spoke about their own life.
Whether they had close friends, what their family life was like, or whether they were dealing with mental illness—none of this was mentioned.
It is possible that all of it was carried alone.

Perhaps this echoes the words spoken earlier: “Don’t keep warming others when you haven’t healed yourself.”
The one who had been soaked by rain, and still tried to hold an umbrella for others, the one who did everything they could to bring light to strangers—has now left us.

Perhaps this was not truly their ending.
In this cycle, they were simply stopped at a certain moment.
We do not have the ability to reload a save and begin again.
All that remains is this outcome before us.
