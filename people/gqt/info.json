But i haven't related to someone like this in a very long time. Your note.. struggles.. goals.. unsuccessful treatments. I have dealt with much similar things and have been fighting to survive for years. I still struggle a lot, and sometimes I feel like ending it too. But reading your note, and the love your friends have for you, and seeing how saddening this situation is, it has touched me in a way that no therapy or medicine can. You have convinced me to at least try just a bit harder.. to check in with my loved ones and friends.. to keep on moving through my pain no matter what. To not give up. You may be gone, but your story and existence means something to me, to everyone you touched with your soul. Thank you Ara, for showing what I needed to see in this moment.  I am so sorry that you were consumed by your struggles, and I wish the very best for you moving forwards, wherever you are.","submitter":"R","date":"Aug 7, 2025"},{"id":21645,"content":"you are loved. there’s nothing else I can say that hasn’t already been said, but you are loved.","submitter":"Anonymous","date":"Aug 7, 2025"},{"id":21646,"content":"I hope you're in a happier place now.
