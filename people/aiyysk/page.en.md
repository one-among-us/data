## Introduction

Aiyysk is an MTF girl who loves digital & network technology, and also flashing custom ROMs on Android devices.

She comes from a single-parent family and frequently experiences domestic violence. She suffers from depression and dissociative disorder, along with severe somatic symptoms.

At 2:00 a.m. on February 19, 2024 (GMT+8, same applies to all times mentioned hereafter), shortly after her birthday, she ran away from home to Shanghai.

At 0:00 a.m on December 15, 2024, after learning of the tragic passing of another MTF a few days earlier, she and another MTF ingested a large quantity of medication and chemical solutions, leaving this world.

<summary>This is the story of how I first met her...</summary>

I met her through a help-seeking post on CoolAPK - she had a Snapdragon 855 Qualcomm Reference Design (QRD) prototype that wouldn’t boot due to a failed flashing attempt, leaving her with no choice but to seek help. After leaving a message offering assistance, we quickly added each other on QQ.

After listening to her description of the problem, I realized she had made the same mistake I once did: switching the system slot[^1]. However, the B slot on these prototypes was empty, which caused the device to fail to boot and get stuck in EDL mode[^2].

During our conversation, I learned that her situation was not good. When I tried to learn more, she declined, saying, “Just focus on yourself, don’t worry about me.”

Later, she opened up to me, sharing that she had been experiencing domestic violence and had attempted to run away from home multiple times.

When the device finally booted up again, she was overjoyed. She said, “I’ve been struggling with this device for two months - thank you so much.” It felt truly rewarding to be able to help someone with what little knowledge I had.

As we continued talking, she confessed to me that she was a MTF and sent a photo. In the picture, boxes of medications like Progynova and Cyproterone could be seen. I was a bit stunned and asked her again.

“...Are you... joking?”

“No, I’m not.”

“So... you’re MTF?”

“I’m MTF, what about it?”

“I used to think MTF folks were hard to approach - maybe that’s just an impression from browsing Twitter.”

“Everyone is different; it’s just that you perceive them as hard to approach. Maybe you feel nervous when interacting with them, or find it hard to relate.”

“I’ve never really interacted with an MTF person before - I only knew such a community existed. I was afraid to reach out because I worried my wording might hurt them, so I always kept my distance out of respect.”

“I get it, I’ve felt the same way.”

This was my first time talking to an MTF person. As a cis straight guy, I struggled to process all this information at the time. To collect my thoughts, I didn’t reply to her messages for two or three days. After gathering my courage, I finally resumed our conversation.

“Are you there?”

“I’m sorry.”

“Hey, it’s okay. Sending hugs ❤️”

“My mind’s been filled with dark thoughts lately - I didn’t want to affect you, so I stayed quiet.”

“Not at all, it only makes me more worried about you.”

“This all feels so surreal, I can hardly believe it...”

“What’s wrong? *gently pats*”

“Like I said before, I always thought MTFs were hard to approach, and I didn’t know how to interact without hurting them.”

“Just treat them normally~ I understand your concern~”

“The problem is, what’s considered ‘normal’ by most people might not apply here.”

“I won’t make things difficult for friends~ Just interact naturally and kindly. If there’s anything you need, we can work through it together~ *pats the little silly*”

She was so gentle, so full of warmth. From then on, I embraced her as one of my closest friends.

Goodnight. May you be a carefree, lovely girl in your next life.
