## Introduction

Aiyysk was a lovely MTF girl.
Her name is the Chinese transliteration of the Japanese term “異世界” (romanized Isekai, meaning “another world”).

She came from a single-parent family and has frequently experiences domestic violence.
She suffered from depression and dissociative identity disorder, along with severe somatic symptoms.

She was passionate about digital technology and networking, often flashing custom ROMs on her Android devices.

## First Encounter

I met her through a help-seeking post on CoolAPK. 
She had a Snapdragon 855 Qualcomm Reference Design (QRD) prototype that wouldn't boot due to a failed flashing attempt, leaving her with no choice but to seek help.
After leaving a message offering assistance, we quickly added each other on QQ.

After listening to her description of the problem, I realised she had made the same mistake I once made: switching the system slot[^1].
However, the B slot on these prototypes was empty, which caused the device to fail to boot and get stuck in EDL mode[^2].

During our conversation, I learned that her situation was difficult.
But she declined when I tried to learn more about the specific circumstances, and said, “Just focus on yourself, don't worry about me.”

Despite this, she later confided in me that she had been suffering from domestic violence and had attempted to run away from home multiple times.

When the device finally booted up again, she was overjoyed.
She said, “I've been struggling with this device for two months, thank you so much.”

It felt truly rewarding to be able to help someone with what little knowledge I had.

As we continued talking, she confessed to me that she was a MTF and sent a photo.
In the picture, boxes of medications like Progynova and Cyproterone could be seen. I was a bit stunned and asked her again.

Me: “Are you... joking?”

Aiyysk: “No, I'm not.”

Me: “So... you're MTF?”

Aiyysk: “I'm MTF, what about it?”

Me: “I used to think MTF folks were hard to approach - maybe that's just an impression from browsing Twitter.”

Aiyysk:
“Everyone is different; it's just that you perceive them as hard to approach.
Maybe you feel nervous when interacting with them, or find it hard to relate.”

Me:
“I've never really interacted with an MTF person before.
I only knew such a community existed. I was afraid to reach out because I worried my wording might hurt them, so I always kept my distance out of respect.”

Aiyysk: “I get it, I've felt the same way.”

This was my first time talking to a MTF person.
As a “cis straight guy”, I struggled to process all this information at the time.
To collect my thoughts, I didn't reply to her messages for two or three days.
After gathering my courage, I finally resumed our conversation.

Aiyysk: “Are you there?”

Me: “I'm sorry.”

Aiyysk: “Hey, it's okay. Hug~ ❤️”

Me: 
“My mind's been filled with dark thoughts lately.
I didn't want to affect you, so I stayed quiet.”

Aiyysk: “Not at all, it only makes me more worried about you.”

Me: “This all feels so surreal, I can hardly believe it...”

Aiyysk: “What's wrong? Patpat”

Me: “Like I said before, I always thought MTFs were hard to approach, and I didn't know how to interact without hurting them.”

Aiyysk: “Just treat them normally~ I understand your concern~”

Me: “The problem is, what's considered ‘normal’ by most people might not apply here.”

Aiyysk:
“I won't make things difficult for friends~ Just interact naturally and kindly.
If there's anything you need, we can work through it together~ Patpat, your little fool”

She was so gentle, so full of warmth.
From then on, I embraced her as one of my closest friends.

## Running Away from Home

(All times mentioned here are based on the East Eighth Time Zone (UTC+8) standard, and the same applies hereafter.)

February 9, 2024, was the traditional Chinese holiday “New Year's Eve”.
At 19:00 in the evening, my family had already finished dinner and gathered together, discussing the year that was about to pass.
As a younger member, I really couldn't get a word in, so I just scrolled through my phone like other young people.
A few days earlier, two people in Aiyysk's chat group had clashed, arguing fiercely.
I was more or less affected by this and felt a bit anxious.
However, Aiyysk didn't seem too bothered by it.
She said, “This matter is just like that, nothing to be afraid of. Just let it go.”
So, I voiced my concerns.

Me:
“Because I'm really scared, it's because of anxiety. 
I'm afraid of being disliked, and I'm also afraid of others being disliked.”

Aiyysk: “It's best to focus on doing your own part first~”

Me: “Sigh... A friend once described me like this: just like Sayaka from *Puella Magi Madoka Magica*, both quite emotional.”

Aiyysk: “Well, it's okay. Just take your time to get used to it. Patpat~”

Me:
“That's great.
Whenever my anxiety makes me scared, hearing everyone say ‘it's okay’ makes me feel much better. I'm really just a fool.jpg”

Aiyysk: (A seemingly downcast sticker)

Me: “What's wrong? Did something unpleasant happen?”

Aiyysk: “No, I'm anxious too. But not right now. I'm looking at the fool!”

Me: “I'm the fool, heh.”

Aiyysk: “Alright, alright~”

My worries vanished.
Suddenly, I realized it was New Year's Eve, and I hadn't yet extended my New Year greetings to her.

Me: “Mhm, Happy New Year! Sending early wishes.”

Aiyysk: “I don't really like the Chinese New Year.”

Thinking of her situation, this wasn't hard to understand.

Me: “Okay.”

Aiyysk: “I'm running away, leaving home. Don't worry, it's fine. Goodnight.”

Me: “...Huh?”

Aiyysk: “[Auto-reply] So lonely[^3]”

Me: “Is everything okay...?”

Aiyysk: “It's okay.”

Me: “Mhm, please stay safe.”

Aiyysk: “Worried”

Me: “What's wrong? Did something happen?”

Aiyysk:
“It's a timing issue, not sure if I can make it out. 
Can you check out the tweet?”

Me: “Yes, let me see... I get it, it's still a conflict with the family's traditional views, right?”

Aiyysk: “Mhm.”

Me: 
“I saw those three tweets.
Two are about the family's lack of understanding, and the other is just mindless ranting.”

Aiyysk: “Just ignore that troll's post.”

Me:
“Sorry, I don't know how to handle this situation. 
Parents' traditional views aren't something you can just abandon. I can only hope you stay safe.”

Aiyysk: 
“It's mainly a timing issue.
My dad starts work on the 19th and leaves on the evening of the 18th.
If school starts on the 19th, boarding students enter on the evening of the 18th, and day students enter on the morning of the 19th.
We're in the countryside now, and he's taking me to the county town at noon on the 18th. I don't know if he can leave earlier so I can sneak out.”

Me: “Mhm... So you really need to plan carefully. I can't offer much help, but... please stay safe.”

February 18, 21:30, just a few hours before she planned to leave.
It was her birthday, and to commemorate it, I wrote the following and sent it to her chat group:  

> 跨越过去和未来 / 当阳光照进心扉 / 我终于能够走出阴霾
>
> 终于再一次热泪盈眶 / 只因重新获得了 / 那份去拥抱爱的勇气

> Across the past and the future / When sunlight fills my heart / I finally step out of the gloom
>
> Tears well up once again / Only because I've regained / The courage to embrace love

“Anyway, the reason I wrote this poem is that I'm truly grateful to have met everyone. I, who have always longed for love and understanding but was never accepted...”

However, her current situation wasn't great. She said she had rhinitis, a sore throat, and gum inflammation. At 23:18, she complained in the group.

Aiyysk:
“Why is my aunt being so extra?
The living room lights are on, so of course my room looks lit.
She says I turned on the light and tells me to turn it off.”  

“I'm thinking about moving the suitcase downstairs later. How? It's so heavy.”

Me: “You should've moved it down in batches ahead of time.”

Aiyysk: “There are people watching at home.”

February 19, 0:56, already midnight.  

Group Member A:  
“Is Aiyysk about to make a move?”

Aiyysk: “My family isn't asleep, they're all active in the living room.”

Group Member A:
“Ah? Wait until 2–3 a.m., find a time when they've all gone to sleep.”

Group Member B:
“How are your preparations? Do you have the determination and courage?”

Aiyysk: “Everything's ready, but why aren't they going to sleep yet...”

At 2:11, she sent a few pictures in the chat.
Under the dim streetlights, she held her suitcase and set off on her journey.

## Her Departure
At that time, I was hospitalized and undergoing treatment, so I knew very little about this part.
It is a painful memory, and I have no desire to ask those involved for more details.

All I know is, at 0:00 a.m on December 15, 2024, after learning of the tragic passing of a MTF a few days earlier, she and another MTF ingested a large quantity of drugs and chemical solutions, leaving this world.

Goodnight. May you be a carefree, lovely girl in your next life.
