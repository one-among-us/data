## Description

Tsukiko was a non-binary friend among us, whose pronouns were He/Him.

He mentioned that he was fond of *Kagamine Rin* in his Twitter.

He was a rhythm game player, and went to arcade whenever he had time.

He hoped to adopt a cat, but that didn't come true.

A few days before his departure, he took a photo of beautiful night sky and tweeted:

> How much longer can I watch such a sky?

## Departure

> When I passed by your school, I always thought:
>
> If you are still alive, would you leave school like other students?
>
> I had already seen the medicine that day,
>
> "Should I take possession of that? I am so worried about you."
>
> "I won't do that."
>
> You haven't fulfilled your promise, you are such a big liar.
> 
> According to my memory, you are afraid of pain, even morphine cannot relieve that.
> 
> I deferred your will and didn't call the police. But I was too far away from your home. You had departed before I arrived.
>
> You said that you love warm hugs; I want to hug you again.
> 
> Good night, Tsukiko. Be a normal boy in your next life, and may you be happy always.
>
> I hope every one take care of themselves. Humans are prone to be hurt. Don't self-harm or overdose; that will just bring tragedies.
