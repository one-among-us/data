## Description

Tsukiko is a non-binary friends among us, who hopes to be called as He/Him.

He mentioned that he was fond of *Kagamine Rin* in his Twitter comment.

He was one of Maimai players, and he would go to the arcade if time permitted.

He hoped to keep a cat, although the wish didn't come true.

## Departure

A few days before his leave, he shotted a photo of beautiful dusk sky and tweeted:

> How much longer can I watch such a sky?

<PhotoScroll photos={[ '${path}/photos/sky.jpg',]} />  

It was a pity that the pain and anxiety of life overwhelmed him, and he chose to leave this world in the early hours of the day inside his room.

Good night, Tsukiko. Wish that you always be accompanied by cute cats.
