## Introduction

Yu Yutou was our ally.
We all call her YuYu.

YuYu documented her everyday life through scattered tweets,
and through her words one could sense her gentleness and kindness.

She liked ice cream in the summer,
and also liked leaving the air conditioner on while cooking a small hot pot and catching up on the lastest anime.
Putting ice cubes into her cola was a must for her. Because it’s REAAAAAAAAAALLY refreshing!

Even when overdosing,
she would still eat some small snacks and drink different beverages to ease her mood.

As an ACG culture enthusiast,
her cupboard was filled with FuFu plush dolls and all kinds of figurines.
She had also bought and worn JK skirts.

YuYu’s pinned images also displayed many original artwork drafts aside from nice selfies.
Her drawings were full of her own rhythm and thoughtful details,
making her personal style immediately recognisable at a glance.

Faced with life’s troubles and anxiety, she harmed herself.
Even while hurting herself, she always hoped that others would be happy.

> “Xiaogu, promise me. Don’t hurt your body because of those people, okay?”
>
> “I hope this 52 (yuan red packet) can make Xiaogu a bit happier, but you have to promise me that at least today you won’t self-harm because of those people. Otherwise, you’re not allowed to accept it!”

But just as she herself said: harming oneself is so easy, yet persuading others not to self-harm is so hard.

## Falling

MAY 21:

“I’m planning to buy some to prepare (for suicide)first, so that one day when I’m unhappy, I can leave effortlessly.”

MAY 23:

“It finally arrived. I’ll go pick it up tomorrow. If everything goes smoothly, maybe June.”

MAY 31:

“From today on, I can’t keep being so down. I have to work hard. YuYu, you can do it!”

JUNE 3:

“Actually, today is my birthday. Yay—happy birthday!”

JUNE 10:

“Sometimes I also think about going to see a psychologist, but I still feel like… never mind.”

JUNE 11:

“After I die, I don’t want another life, nor do I want to go to heaven or hell. I want to return to nothingness. This is a result I’ve long yearned for day and night, so there’s no need to worry about me.”

“I’m very glad to have met everyone on Twitter. I hope that everyone who sees this tweet can be happy every day. Good night.”

## Afterword

YuYu’s companionship, care, and comfort for everyone were all contained within those short replies.
When friends needed help, she would also offer practical suggestions.

From her first truly personal tweet to her departure, it was just a little over a month.
The time we spent with her was so brief.
Her state of mind fell rapidly—or perhaps everything had already collapsed long before May, and she simply chose not to reveal too much pain in her writing, instead using fragmented displays of happiness to shield everyone.

But sadly, not all stories are long ones.
Her story with us came to an end, and the pen that could have continued writing ran dry amid the ticking of a clock that never stopped.
