Hangmster is our ally.

They often interacted with friends on Twitter/X, bringing us laughter.
They gave warm hugs when we needed them, consoled us when we were anxious, and mourned for our departed friends.

They seldom mentioned what they loved. However, according to their tweets, they were interested in cute things such as cats. They were fond of Hatsune Miku as well. On the Hatsune Miku 15th anniversary, they expressed their happiness by drawing an illustration:

Hangmster was often troubled by insomnia and anxiety. They once said that they didn't like their body, and their less traditional self-expression online made them more comfortable.

Unfortunately, although they always encouraged us to live bravely, they still chose to leave at the beginning of the year.

Rest well, Hangmster. May you can be yourself.
