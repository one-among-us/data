Mio is from Guangdong, Foshan.
Her father is a high school teacher; her mother takes care of everything at home.
She has an older sister who is also trans.
She was admitted to one of the top universities in China because of her brilliance and dexterousness.

> My IQ is 130, my IQ is 130!
> ——Mio when she was small (in primary school)

In life, she liked to play *Minecraft* and *Karbel Space Program*.
After all these years, she became a gentle big sister to many people.

She suffered major depression disorder throughout the last year of her life.
Although she was pushed to suicide several times, she still tried to live as happily as she could.
She made many friends and built up many relationships in that year alone:

- She came out to her best friend in primary school.
- She became close friends with another trans girl.
- She started to manage the QQ group *Harunome Hanbai*.

## From best "boy" friends to best girl friends with her friend whom she met in primary school

In 2022 April, [Bei Yan Yun Yi](https://github.com/BeiyanYunyi) saw a social media post from Mio.
It was also at that time that Bei Yan Yun Yi figured out her gender identity.
Bei Yan Yun Yi remembered that Mio had done research on SRS during primary school.
Therefore, when she reconnected with Mio, she came out to her.
Just like that, best "boy" friends become best girl friends.

> Mio: Do you have a moment right now?
>
> Me (Translator's note: The sender is Bei Yan Yun Yi, her friend whom she met in primary school): Sure.
> 
> Me: So I was thinking, are you trans?
>
> Mio: How did you know?
> 
> Mio: Hey~
>
> Me: Because I remembered that you had already researched SRS in primary school.
>
> Mio: Is it because you saw my Tieba (Translator's note: a popular social media platform) post?
>
> Me: No, I haven't checked Tieba in a while. I did see your Wechat (Translator's note: another popular social media platform) post, though.
> 
> Me: Have you considered what you're experiencing to be Gender Dysphoria?
> 
> Mio: Probably. . .
> 
> Me: I think we need to meet. How about May 1st? (Translator's note: a holiday)
> 
> Me: (photo, a Wechat post)

> > I don't identify with most of what is commonly considered "male qualities". (Means I don't want to be a man.) I don't want to be the object of "male gaze", too. (That is disgusting.)
> > I only have one choice left:

## Built up another friendship

During one month, Mio and her close friend spent time together six times.
The backpacks they bought together recorded their friendship silently:

Her friend didn't expect the goodbye at the airport became the last time she could ever see her:

In China mainland, graduation certificates are void after a gender marker change;
SRS is required to change the gender marker.
Therefore, only people who are "lucky" enough to be able to afford and go through SRS before graduation can gain their graduation certificates.

Mio was trying to make that money in the hope that she can gain enough money for SRS before graduation.
Unfortunately, her depression left her unable to learn programming so she couldn't make money that way.
Therefore, she resorted to being a driver instead.
However, she was demanded over a thousand (more than she had earned) and got mocked for being trans after an accident in which no one was hurt.

And therefore:

Despite her best efforts, she was overpowered by another episode of depression and suicidal thoughts on 2023 February 24th, two days after the accident.
This time, she didn't tell anyone about her plan and only set up a scheduled Tweet at noon the next day.
When her mother found her, it was already too late.

> Therefore, the real reasons behind her suicide are problems in society and in her own family:
> 
> Most people don't understand depression and Gender Dysphoria.
> 
> Most people disapprove of trans people and gender-confirming treatments.
> 
> A few people persuade others into suicide for fun.
> 
> These factors caused tragedies after tragedies.
> Therefore, I must say that it was already mostly determined at the start.

> Let's wish her rest in peace.
