> ——Mio when she was small (in primary school)

She learnt about SRS during primary school, as well.

In life, she liked to play *Minecraft* and *Karbel Space Program*.
After all these years, she became a gentle big sister to many people.

She sufferred from major depression disorder throughout the last year of her life.
Although she was pushed to suicide several times, she still tried to live as happily as she could.
She made many friends and built up many relationships in that year alone:

- She came out to her best friend in primary school.
- She became close friends with another trans girl.
- She started to manage the QQ group 春の芽工作室.

During one month, Mio and her close friend (mentioned above) spent time together six times.
The backpacks they bought together recorded their friendship silently:

Even with her best efforts, she was overpowered by another episode of depression and suicidal thoughts on 2023, Feburary 24th.
This time, she did not tell anyone about her plan and only set up a scheduled Tweet at noon next day.
When her mother found her, it was already too late.

These are the last text messages she had ever sent:

May you rest in peace, Mio.
