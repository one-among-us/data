## Description

Kotori was fond of mathematics and physics.
She enrolled in the Department of Physics at the School of Physical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in the fall of 2017.

Her old account was “Partial Differential”, with an avatar depicting the character `∂`,
which was a stylized cursive `d’ mainly used as a mathematical symbol, usually to denote a partial derivative such as `∂z/∂x`.

Kotori was an introverted girl. She rarely engaged in conversations with others or shared her viewpoints in public.
However, she was enthusiastic about academic inquiries and always actively participated in discussions, occasionally expressing appreciation for her friends’ excellent ideas.
She frequently deleted her responses on Zhihu or made them anonymous.
Nonetheless, we can still find many of her insightful answers, continuing to reflect her brilliance.

She immersed herself in her favourite subjects and achieved the following:
“*Scientia et studium quaestio et cogitatio*”, which means rich in knowledge and tenacious of purposes, inquiring with earnestness and reflecting with self-practice.

Kotori had another well-known nickname, “Truth-seeking Salted Fish”.
But considering her ability, it might be more appropriate to call her a truth-seeking whale in the ocean.

She could be considered a genius in mathematics and physics.
Maybe she could’ve made significant contributions to the field of theoretical physics...

But as the saying goes, “The talented die young”.

## Departure

Kotori struggled with depression and gender dysphoria, which negatively impacted her mental health.
She attempted to take her own life but was rescued.

After consulting numerous references to ascertain the lethal dose of the drug,
she ended her life on the morning of September 24th, 2019.

After that, her friends tried to contact the local police and USTC management.
However, it was too late.

## Memorial

Under the Zhihu question [What are your thoughts about Zhihu user @Cheng-pei-qi-52](https://www.zhihu.com/question/347747351) and related obituaries, many friends of Kotori expressed their sadness and regret at her passing.

Her friends continued to long for her presence.
Even the very sight of the character `∂` filled them with deep sorrow.

Countless friendships and tales of acquaintance had now become mere fragments of the past...

Goodbye, Kotori, but we will never say goodbye.

You will live on in our hearts.

<!-- May her memory be eternal -->
