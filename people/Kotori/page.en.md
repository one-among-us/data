## Description

Kotori was a girl who loved mathematics and physics, she entered the Department of Physics, School of Physics Science, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Fall 2017.

Another account ID of her was "Partial Differential",
and avatar of that account was also the character ∂, which was a stylized cursive d mainly used as a mathematical symbol, usually to denote a partial derivative such as $∂z/∂x$.

Kotori was an introverted girl.
She seldom talked with others or expressed her point of views in public.
But she was passionate about academic questions,
and she would always join in the discussion and applaud for the neat idea of her friends.

Many ideas or works of her would be deleted by herself after she wrote them,
or she just wrote them anonymously.
There are still some answers of her saved on Zhihu now,
and we can feel the brilliance in those answers belonging to her.

She was obsessed with her favourite subjects, and achieved that "erudite and Atsushi, cut near the question thinking."

Kotori had another well-known nickname, Truth-seeking salted fish.
But in terms of her ability, she was a truth-seeking whale in the ocean indeed.

She was so good at mathematics and physics that she could also be considered as a talented girl.
Maybe she would make great contributions in the field of theoretical physics in the future...

But fate always mess up with geniuses.

## Departure

Kotori suffered from depression and gender dysphoria,
and her mental health was not so good.
She had tried to take herself before her last attempt.
Fortunately, she had been rescued at that time.

She consulted many references to confirm the lethal dose of drug.
Finally, she chose to end her life on the morning of September 24th, 2018.

After that, her friends attempted to contact with USTC authorities, and police in Poyang, Shangrao.
But Kotori cannot be treated in time, and she was unable to recover and left us at last.

## Memorial

In Zhihu question [What are your thoughts about ZhiHu user @Cheng Peiqi](https://www.zhihu.com/question/347747351) and her obituary, many friends of Kotori expressed their sadness and regret of the death of her.

Her friends always missed her very much,
even when one of them used the character ∂, they felt painful in their heart.

Countless companionship, and stories of getting to know each other had finally become fragments of the past days...

Goodbye, Kotori, but we will never say goodbye.

*May your memory be eternal.*
