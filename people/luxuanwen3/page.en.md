## Description

Nini was a sweet trans girl with a keen interest in computers. She experienced some anxiety, and was generally warm and friendly.
She took medication and exogenous hormones on a monthly basis. Her avatar was created by the talented artist [ディーバ/Deaver](https://x.com/Deaver1229).

However, her parents were resolutely opposed to her transgender identity and expression, so she was closely monitored.
The only sister who truly understood her found it difficult to communicate owing to distance and academic pressures.

Towards the end of July 2024, there was an extreme increase in conflict between Nini and her parents.
Her parents decided to stop her hormone replacement therapy and other medications, and they began to regard her as rebelling against orthodoxy.
This was the first time she had considered taking her own life.
After taking a significant amount of drugs and leaving her home, she was fortunate to be found by passersby after collapsing on the street.
Subsequently, Nini was unable to access the drugs.

At 11:55 p.m. on August 4, 2024, Nini made her final decision.
After posting her last tweet, she took an overdose of chemicals.
Her close friends rushed to save her.
However, at 3 a.m. the next morning, Nini left us to pursue her own path and seek her freedom.

Nini was very warm to people, though this was not always evident in her outward demeanor.
Rather, it was reflected in the pieces of her words that conveyed her equal and full love for everyone.
She might call you "babe" and offer a hug.
She would patiently explain what you didn't know and try not to pass on her negativity to her friends.
