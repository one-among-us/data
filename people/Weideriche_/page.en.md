## Description

Zihe was a non-binary ally of us, whose pronouns were always She/Her.

Generally speaking, she was a gentle and broad-minded girl, but she couldn't get enough happiness or love.

She would care for others when others were hurt.

> Meow~ Don't use alcohol to disinfect the wound, it could be very painful.

She had tried to face the difficulty of life with a smile. She had a good time with us.

Owing to factors like her bad family environment, her mental health worsened.
She started to self-harm and overdose, and planned to take her own life.

She left this world with her partner in Zhongshan, Guangdong on November 5th, 2023.
