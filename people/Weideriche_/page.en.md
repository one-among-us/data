## Description

Zihe was a non-binary ally of us, whose pronouns were always She/Her.

她也非常贴心，在他人受伤的时候，也会向其他人表达自己的关心。

> 喵，有伤口不要用酒精x

In a word, she was a girl who was gentle and broad-minded, but she couldn't get enough happiness and love.

She was our intimate friend as well, she would express her caring when others were hurt.

> Meow~ Don't use alcohol to disinfect the wound, it will be very painful.

She had ever been in the face of difficulty of life, and had a good time with us.

Owing to factors like her bad family environment, her mental health worsened.
She started to self-harm and overdose, and planned to commit suicide.

She left this world with her partner in Zhongshan, Guangdong on November 5th, 2023.
