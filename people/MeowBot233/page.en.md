## Dream of a Dreamlike Girl

Afflicted by a terminal illness.

Confined to her bed.

Yet, within her slumber,

wonderful dreams come to her every night.

In the realm of her dreams,

She wandered and played everywhere with her beloved.

From twilight’s embrace till dawn’s arrival,

She would dream of ——

Her beloved waiting at the hospital gates.

Every evening, hand in hand:

Together, they would wander, 

and explore countless experiences.

As nightfall descended,

the girl fell into her dreams swiftly.

then together with her beloved,

kissed and hugged each other.

went through shops,

played games,

and finding solace in her beloved’s embrace...

Later, in their conversations,

she noticed something out of the ordinary:

Her beloved appeared exhausted during the day.

Once, she came out to play with her beloved at night in her dream.

Her beloved bought a pendant.

Later, during their video call,

She noticed the same pendant,

it had never appeared before.

The girl shared her dream tales,

her beloved seemed to have also experienced them.
 
One day, she realized,

The dreams every night weren’t mere fantasies,

but out-of-body experiences.

Her soul intertwined with her beloved’s,

making every dream a reality.

After that, the girl fled the hospital,

and reunited with her beloved.

They lived happily shortly,

before her health declined.

And she passed away in the arms of her beloved.

Yet her soul lingered,

bounding eternally with her beloved.

## Outside the Story

There is a catgirl, brave and lovely.
An angel she is.

She loves tiramisu the most; 
it combines the sweetness of milk with the bitterness of coffee.
She also loves other sweets.

She was always deeply in love with a person.
From the end of 2021 to the fall of 2023.
Maybe longer.

It was a story about love.

Maybe you heard of that story.

You might feel sad for the fragments of memories contained within it,

sighing...

“Life is beautiful but fragile.”

Yet...

> The deceased would not come back no matter how much you wish for it.
> Changes must be fulfilled by the living.
>
> Maybe this is comfort.

When you’re tired and struggle to see a light, it’s okay.

You don’t have to exert yourself too much.

Wipe your tears, and rest for a bit.

There are soothing views everywhere:

Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter.

And “Love”.

May you be happy every day.
