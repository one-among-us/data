...Well, I posted that too early on socials.  
Stuff in the stomach has not been digested...and acid reflux

I'm having some strange feelings——
——I think I want to go and play with you

I love you,
But my love is buried deep in my heart.
The time when you hate me and forget me
is when I have finally succeeded.
