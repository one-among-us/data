## Introduction

When people talk about lxyddice (líng xià yī dù de ice, means “ice crystal below 0 degrees”),
they often describe her as a kind-hearted and thoughtful person,
always putting others first.  

She constantly looked for ways to help others,
thinking, “Compared to some, I’m already quite fortunate.”
And with that thought, she’d quietly watch her friends grow and improve bit by bit.  

Lxy was an avid fan of W-chan from *Arknights*, using her as an avatar across many platforms.
Skilled in multiple programming languages,
she enjoyed creating interesting projects—like frameworks for DingTalk mini-apps, code for running DingTalk bots, and a customizable DG-LAB plugin for VSCode.
She also set up a *Minecraft* server (Lxycraft). It was a small but cozy haven with her friends.

On her profile, even though she humbly described her skills in various programming languages as “average”, everyone agreed that she was truly brilliant.

Countless things about her left a lasting impression on everyone.

## Her Departure  

Lxy’s sudden departure was a tremendous shock to her friends.

She left behind only a few words filled with warmth and care for those around her.  

Family conflicts, depression, and anxiety took a heavy toll on her.
She had placed her last hope in therapy,
but her psychologist couldn’t provide the support she needed—beyond medication,
the counselling itself didn’t make a difference.  

As one chat log suggested,
perhaps, in the end,
she could only rely on herself — learning to love herself and finding the strength to keep going.  

She gave all her love and kindness to others and left none for herself.

## Some Memories of Her Friend

AloneStar bid farewell to her with a playthrough of *Arcaea*'s *Last | Moment*.

During the gameplay, they triggered a <span style="background: linear-gradient(180deg, #d20f39, #f38ba8); font-weight: bold; background-clip: text; color: transparent">Lost</span> and a <span style="background: linear-gradient(180deg, #fe640b, #f9e2af); font-weight: bold; background-clip: text; color: transparent">Far</span> with intent — the <span style="background: linear-gradient(180deg, #d20f39, #f38ba8); font-weight: bold; background-clip: text; color: transparent">Lost</span> symbolising her absence, and the <span style="background: linear-gradient(180deg, #fe640b, #f9e2af); font-weight: bold; background-clip: text; color: transparent">Far</span> representing the lingering regrets between them.

> At the beginning, you taught me how to unpick a skirt’s seam line, and then we gradually started chatting about this and that…over these two years, we talked about so many things.

> Of course I have regrets. By the time I realized what was happening, it was too late. You were already gone. I never knew what your final message said, or why you made that choice.

> Such is life, isn’t it?
>  
> Maybe it’s just the nature of *Earth Online*, a game you can only play once in your lifetime.

> This will be the last time I say goodnight to you.  
>  
> So, goodnight, lxyddice.
