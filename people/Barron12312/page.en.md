Barron was a happy transgirl who studied painting in Japan. She had a dream to open a comic studio. But unfortunately, due to the family crash and her coming out, she was forced to give up her studies and returned to China at the end of May 2023 after tried to commit suicide but survived in Japan.

After returned to China, she lost almost all her financial resources. To make matters even worse, she was unable to draw again due to her serious PTSD. She found good friends in Guangzhou who could accompany her, and then lived shortly in Beijing. During her live in Beijing, although she was often worried about finance and other issues, she was quite happy with everyone's comfort. 

However, owing to financial reason and her beloved, she returned to Guangzhou at the end of August. She and her beloved spent quality time in Guangzhou, although they had to rely on sugar dating to survive. Even though she faced challenges in her relationship...she bravely confronted the trials of life. 

Barron once said that she was on a girl's last tour...Tragically, she has left us too soon and ended her own tour. During her journey, she once left such words, "Exceedingly wish that someone would remember me."

Rest well, Barron. We will all remember you. Hope you have a blissful trip to the heaven.
