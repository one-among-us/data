Barron was a happy trans girl who studied painting in Japan.
She had a dream to open a manga studio.
But unfortunately, due to family discord and her coming out, she was forced to give up her studies and return to China at the end of May 2023 after failed to commit suicide in Japan.

After returning to China, she lost almost all her income sources.
To make matters even worse, she was unable to draw again due to her serious PTSD.
She found some good friends in Guangzhou who could accompany her, and then lived shortly in Beijing. During her time in Beijing, although she was often worried about finance and other issues, she was quite happy with everyone's comfort.

However, owing to financial reason and her beloved, she returned to Guangzhou at the end of August. She and her beloved spent quality time in Guangzhou, although they had to engage in sex work to survive.
Even though she faced challenges in her relationship, she bravely confronted the trials of life. 

Barron once said that she was on a girl's last tour.
Tragically, she left us too soon and ended her own tour. During her journey, she once left such words, "Really wish that someone would remember me."

Rest well, Barron. We will all remember you.
Hope you have a blissful trip to heaven.
