## Description

Mushroom was a trans girl who tried to live.

She shared her daily life on social media,
sometimes posting photos of herself.
Her answers to Zhihu questions also included her daily life and photos.

Her favourite dessert was a sweet strawberry sundae.
She also enjoyed drinking canned iced cola.

To support herself,
she attended an interview to become a streamer for MOMO,
and she achieved a significant milestone soon after starting.
The women colleagues at her company understood her transgender identity and challenges.
They encouraged her to be herself and move forward;
one of them even invited her to her house.

When she was tired, she would treat herself with food and drinks.

Her father started to support her gradually,
so she started looking forward to SRS.

Mushroom had a girlfriend.
They met on February 11th, 2017, and accompanied each other for several months.
They visited Shenzhen Fisherman Wharf, watched many exciting movies, and enjoyed endless delicious foods.

## Her Departure

Mushroom has always been struggling with depression,
and she needed to take several kinds of medicine daily.

“The doctor said that if I take these medicines regularly, everything would be fine.”

“I don’t really wanna die. I always endeavour to live.”

……

Before she departed, she smiled sweetly at everyone.

## After Her Departure

Mushroom once excerpted a passage from Shen Nanxi's answer to Zhihu question [What are your favourite sentences orpersonal status?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/36442613/answer/207763687) as a reflection to herself.

> There is only one hell in this world,
> 
> which is the world we live in now.
>
> You may think you are kind because you are a fallen angel,
> 
> but you are just the weakest amidst the devils.

After Mushroom’s departure, Shen Nanxi wrote a [memorial essay](https://archive.md/hQ7AS) for her to express her mourning.

> At last, I wish you well.
>
> We will finally meet again,
>
> in that distant and warm world.

Goodnight, Mushroom. May you be a happy mushroom in another world🍄.
