## Description

She loves Sunflowers. She once told me she feels some kind of predestined affinity with Sunflowers.

She is persistent when it comes to her art.

She likes to drink Monster Energy.

She often tells me she cannot have a good meal.

She thinks she don't have many friends.

Her first language is Russian.

She knows how to play guitar.

Her parents fought a lot.

She didn't consider her life more valuable than others'.

If she believes sacrificing herself would benefit others, she won't have a second thought.

She cares about her friends a lot.

She's a Eastern Orthodox Christian.

She doesn't really trust God 100%, though.

She came up with her nickname “Ling Shui Yu Yu Zi” while feeding fish.
“Ling Shui Yu Yu Zi” means fish in clear water.

She began transitioning because:

1.  Her parents told her they wanted a daughter. She felt she was born with the wrong sex.

2.  She decided on who she wanted to become after immersing in ACG culture and found out about the futa character stereotype.

3.  A character she created became more and more similar to herself. She wanted to replace her.

4.  Pressure from family and school was becoming increasingly heavy. She wanted to escape the body she was born with but don't have the means to do so.

While trying to console her friend, a conflict ensued. She swallowed lots of her meds that night and argued with her father after waking up.
She then attempted suicide and was sent to the hospital. She was confirmed to be died and cremated by August 1st, 2023.
