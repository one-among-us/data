Zha Ke (Lilith) was a transgender man. We have little information of him, only a letter he left to the world.

<details>
<summary>My Will</summary>
> I have been continuously harrassed by people online for two years because my inability to adapt to society and stupidity.
> I had been doxxed by both people online and in the real world; the police wasn't able to do much.
> I have mental health issues like borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder type 2, severe anxiety, PTSD.
> Maybe it's because of my own personality problems, which might stemmed from my mental health issues.
> I cannot take care of myself nor do I have enough money.
> For a long time, I've been tortured by suicial thoughts.
> Therefore, here is my will:
>
> 1.  I wish my parents won't damage my stuff.
> 2.  I wish my remains would be sent into the sea.
> 3.  I wish all my online presence be erased.
> 4.  I wish there's no funeral.
> 5.  My suicide isn't because of other people.
> 6.  I wish my haters refrain from hating me after my death.
>
> Works like *Suicide Room* and *No Longer Human* expresses the sentiment of the pain of living.
> I don't wish to become a secular person like Lucien in *Kill Your Darlings*.
> I wished to live freely like Sid Vicious from the band *Sex Pistols*, but I know the pain he holds deep inside and the sufferings he had experienced.
> I know I cannot become someone like him.
> Although these may sound a little chunibyo, I'm not going to keep those thoughts all to myself anymore.
>
> People come and go and few ended up friends with me.
> Thinking of all those who had left, how many of them were actually nice to me?
> Yet I kept thinking about their wellbeing, even me myself is starting to think there's something wrong with me.
> Even if I die and see them in the afterlife, they might not be nice to me.
> Yet I keep thinking about them.
>
> I feel extreme pain just from living.
> I know I'm turning numb, but sometimes my heart beats faster anyway, reminding me I'm easily agitated.
> Maybe I have already lost the ability to love. I might never love anyone ever again.
> This is my own fault and my own problem.
> I know people love me and care about me but I can't feel it.
>
> What I can't gain is what I can't gain no matter how much I work for it.
> Maybe I'm actually flawed as a human.
> Why do I keep loving people I shouldn't?
> Why can't I keep it to myself?
>
> Maybe I won't gain true love. Maybe I won't even be able to maintain any long-term relationships.
> I will spend my days in emptiness without feeling the vibrance of life.
> I will suffer in the eternity of being burdened by my sins.
>
> Before, when people told me nicely the importance of studying, I thought they were trying to tell me to off myself asap.
> I know they're trying to tell me to accept reality, but I couldn't accept it until now.
> I should set aside my ambitions and accept the crumbling reality.
>
> I'm a piece of trash and everytime I listen to sad songs I feel a bit moved.
> Yet I don't even have the ability to continuously feel sad anymore.
> I cannot do anything well.
> I even lost the right to be sad.
>
> To think a person would feel extreme loneliness in a crowd of billions.
> To think a person would be overcome by suicial thoughts yet no one saw a sign.
> What kind of society is this?
> That's not a society; it's a lair of beasts.
>
> — *On Suicide* Bocher
>
> My future plans are nothing but suicide.
> Suicide has always been the least difficult option.
> Only suicide can release me from my suffering.
> Remember we lived under one sky.
> Remember you are not alone when we separate.
>
> December 13th, 2021 to April 6th 2023
> — Zha Ke
>
> The world abandoned me long ago.
> I'll be forgotten by everyone eventually.
