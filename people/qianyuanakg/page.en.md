## Description

Qianyuan was a lovely and pretty girl, whose pronouns were She/They.

She was an art student, and some of the avatars she used were drawn by herself.

She liked her long hair and wore lovely clothes.

She always shared about her daily life. Whether she saw cute cats or beautiful flowers, or she had a bad day, she would share them to us.

Interestingly, she has a lovely sister who bites others (playfully and harmlessly) sometimes.

## Some Memories of Her Friend

I met Qianyuan in November 2022. In my impression, she was a lively high-school student. 

She had dishevelled hair of medium length, which grew over her ears and nearly covered her eyes.
She always wore a light gray scarf and a light green coat.
She was truly an adorable child.

Since we first met online, she'd said that she wanted to played with me.
It was a pity that we cannot meet each other during the time from November to February of following year. In the end, we never met irl.

Although she would feel embarrassed in the public, she still hoped to make friends.
She participated in some trans girl irl gatherings several times, but few people tried to start a conversation with her.
So she was on her phone in a corner, then went away to find me.

She once excitedly shared a link of comic con to me. It was a pity that we were unable to attend because of the costly tickets.

She was a very gentle girl. She would listen and respond carefully when you share your burdens with her, and she had a great sense of consoling people.
In addition, she always pleaded us not to overdose, and half jokingly told us not to become "bad girls". 

Her departure was the most regretful and sad thing I learnt in the transgender community.
I might have had a chance to persuade her and play with her...

## Departure

Qianyuan was often insulted by her family, not allowed to like things of many kinds and forced to take part in useless family dinner parties.
Owing to her bad relationship with her family, her mental health worsened.

During the time from December 2022 to January 2023, there was indication of her plan to leave. But that received little attention.

Two days before her departure, she asked her friend if she wanted to come out and play for the last time.
On 20th February, she chose to leave the world.

In her last moment, she still thought of everyone in her will:

> Thank you for your company all along, and I wish you live in the days you have left.
>
> Your opinions toward me are not important, because I had loved you. I loved you all very much.
>
> I put my last words in my heart, because I am afraid others hear that. I want to tell those who have accompanied me and assisted me, I am so sorry...
>
> â€” Extracted from Qianyuan's will
