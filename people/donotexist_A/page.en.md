## Description

*Exist* was a cute girl, so she was pretty popular.
Everyone who meets Exist would be moved by her welcomeness and cheerfulness.
Despite needing to take many medications and [often having to stay in the hospital](https://twitter.com/donotexist_A/status/1383379769903910915?s=20) because of her bipolar disorder and other general health issues,
she was able to be on good terms with every doctor and patient she meets.
Here is a drawing of her by an art student she met during one of her stays in the hospital:

Because Exist's haircut was similar to the character Isabelle in *Animal Crossing*;
also because her personality was as cute as that of Isabelle,
we call her Isabelle sometimes.
She however didn't seem to like to be called that sometimes.

Exist had a good fashion sense.
Whether it's “human's clothing” (clothing style most people choose for their everyday life), JK, or lolita,
she was able to find the clothing choices to best express herself.
Exist once found a [tagline signaling gender expression diversity acceptance by *Uniqlo*](https://twitter.com/donotexist_A/status/1352976196766633985?s=20):
“This is a piece clothing designed for girls and women, but it's suitable for boys and men, too!”

Exist likes to read books.
Many types of books.
She has a preference for paper books.
Once, she went to [Huado library](https://twitter.com/donotexist_A/status/1358339066056482817?s=20) for the book *Gender Trouble* by Butler.

Exist likes to try out new things.
She often wandered around the city and found lots of great sceneries other people would have ignored.
Whether it's a bookstore visit, a clothes shopping trip, a night of playing rhythm games together, or trying out various foods,
she can always keep everyone engaged.

Exist has too many good qualities to list.

Exist helped many trans people in Guangdong to build up confidence by using her social media.
She shared her experience of how she was able to get a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and get the prescriptions with everyone.
We believe, if we are able to see Exist one more time, she would share all she saw and learnt during her time in the other world with us.

In 2021, May, Exist died of the low blood pressure caused by medication side effects and complications.
Good night, Exist.
Wish you happiness.
