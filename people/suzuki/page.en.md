Suzuki (Ling Mu Liang Gong) is a mysterious girl from Taiwan, so we are unable to gain detailed information on her.

She is a hardcore computer hardware tinkerer.
Her DIY skills are really good.
We believe that she can make anything as long as she wants to.

> “I really like this server system. I'm going to save up for it!”
>
> “To everyone who worked on this project, thank you!”

Unfortuantely, her young life ended on 2022 December 14th.
A month after that, one of her accounts, [CatEarsLaboratory], managed by her friend, published this message:
“Good night, Suzuki. Wish you can be a girl forever in heaven!”

We were unable to find any archives of her online presence because she always avoided sharing her personal details online and deleted all of her accounts.
Most information about her are already lost in the sea of Internet.
What we do know about her is that she is the creator of [CatEarsLaboratory](https://twitter.com/CatEars2333).
We speculate that what made her left us was online violence.

After Suzuki died, her friend Ling Mu Liang Zhen took over and continued to used her Twitter and Google accounts as she wished for her to “live with her memory”.

We do not know her well, but please wish her rest in peace anyways.
