Suzuki (Ling Mu Liang Gong) is a mysterious girl from Taiwan, so we are unable to gain detailed information on her.

She is a hardcore computer hardware tinkerer.
Her DIY skills are really good.
We believe that she can make anything as long as she wants to.

> “I really like this server system. I'm going to save up for it!”
>
> “To everyone who worked on this project, thank you!”

Unfortunately, her young life ended on 2022 December 14th.
A month after that, her friend [Kagurazaka Yun](https://twitter.com/NaiXi2233/status/1672848353363902469) published this message:
“Good night, Suzuki. Wish you can be a girl forever in heaven!”

We were unable to find any archives of her online presence because she always avoided sharing her personal details online and deleted all of her accounts.
Most information about her are already lost in the sea of Internet.
What we do know about her is that she is the creator of [CatEarsLaboratory](https://twitter.com/CatEars2333) (A wiki website made for trans people).
We speculate that what made her left us was online violence.

After Suzuki died, her friend Ling Mu Zhen Yi took over and continued to used her Twitter and Google accounts as she wished for her to “live with her memory”. However, as of 2023 June 25th, Ling Mu Zhen Yi is missing.

Her former friend Xiang Liang You Zhen might have taken over Ling Mu Zhen Yi’s account for financial gains, but the accounts they took over is now inactive.

We do not know her well, but please wish her rest in peace anyways.
