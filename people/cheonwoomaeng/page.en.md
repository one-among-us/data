## Introduction

Ryu was a Japanese trans girl full of whimsy and joy. She was a source of inspiration and hope for everyone that she met, and one of the kindest souls we've ever met, and she is often described as silly by her close ones. 

Ryu was a huge fan of Robin & Feixiao from *Honkai Star Rail*, Kaoru Hakaze and Midori Takamine from *Ensemble Stars*, *Project Sekai*, *Alien Stage* and many other games of the genre. Oh and Vocaloids and K-Pop.

She has a straw page which is linked on her profile here, Sadly, We've only archived the version after she was outed as trans, and decided to change it to a "male-ish" website, the original one that we knew is lost as of the time of writing
